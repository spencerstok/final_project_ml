258,2/25/2021,14:38,2/25/2021 14:38,gop19t2,1614281926,So with all the hype around GME and AMC Ive eased myself off drinking to now entirely clean after being heavily addicted for the past three years. Ive been waking up at 5 am excited to see the market and I feel like I have a purpose again or at least the spark before the flame of one. That being said when GME hits 1000 I will be getting the rite aid bottle of whiskey from family guy to represent the lowest low I came out of because our you apes  tattooed https://imgur.com/gallery/yFUlBkW,-0.034722222000000004,0.5

I sold all my AMC and GME last week in order to free up my capital and ""invest"" in other stocks.

I devolved from ape form in order to be human and lose more money from these said stocks, when I could've just held on with my once diamond hands and added more funds to my account, instead of selling on a 60%/$1000 loss (not so much to the average person, but to a college student, quite a lot no?)

Now my hands are paper, I wake up this morning and find out that my hands could've been truly diamond, and that it was never a myth, it was always there.

My heart drops as I see the GME stock shoot up, where you guys said you will come back and pick me up along the way, I could've bounced back if I had more faith and ignored the chatter around me who teased me about my losses.  But I stare down and all I see are my fucking paper hands with a $1000 deficit.

Alas, It's too late for me, but it's not too late for the rest of yous.  DON'T SELL.  Hold.  Make this shoot out of the Milky Way.  Make the Hedgies pay.  Sing GME shanties if you need to force yourself off the sell button to stay on course.  And I wish each and everyone of you shooting up, and hopefully see you guys shoot past Pluto.

Wish you all ",-0.010620915,0.410620915

Most retail traders (You) lack the ability to trade before and after the market opens/closes. This is why it is currently down. Once retail traders (You) are able to get back in at market open tomorrow, this will again go up. This is an attempt to scare ppl away from the stock. It will happen every single evening for the next several days so be prepared for this.

2111,2/5/2021,5:42,2/5/2021 5:42,gm2jnp7,1612521736," $AMC....  UPDATE: February 04th, 2021  


What is happening?  
Shorts are ladder attacking the share price back and forth. They've been doing this for a while as we all know. This is illegal for them to do, but the SEC has not done anything about it and likely won't. Is the system rigged? Yes, it is.  


What can we do:  
The share price you see is not technically what the share price should be. The ladder attacks are hedge funds trading shares back and forth between each other which drives the price down. Their goal is to drive the price down using their tactics and ability to do so. The majority of us are buying, not selling. This is good for us because those who bought high can now average down. Do not kid yourself, the Hedge Fund's will continue this for as long as they can to steer you away from buying more, and to convince you to sell. Once you do - they cover. They are not covering with the shares they are trading back and forth. Eventually, these HF's will have to cover and buy back your shares. Yes, this may take longer than you want or expect, but eventually, they WILL give in. When they start buying, they need to increase their bid if people refuse to sell. Eventually, they have to bid up to the lowest price someone will ""ask"" for. This is the significance of HOLDING. Buy, and hold. These cheap prices right now are gold for the retailer.  


The hedge funds are playing serious psychological games that they play to wear down the interests and hype of the stock. Again, do not kid yourself. These guys have billions and will pay good money to learn ways on how to manipulate you and your actions.  


When will the squeeze happen?  
Nobody knows. You cannot ""time the market"". This could happen shortly, or it could happen in a week or two, maybe a month. It all comes down to how long the hedge funds are willing to wait and continue paying interest on their positions. Remember, they need your shares. They can only buy them from you if you are willing to sell them. If everyone just buys and holds, they are stuck. This is the squeeze to force them into buying from you. RIGHT NOW - notice how the share price is flashing back and forth between $7.09 and $6.96 ?? Is that not suspicious ? back and forth? This just proves what they are doing to manipulate.  


Fundamentals:  
AMC is debt free and about to start opening up. That means they are going to start posting revenues in the near future. Why is this important? Because when you have a clean balance sheet of little to no debt and report making good revenue, this looks very very good for the financial world. If a company looks good financially, their stock price will almost always increase. AMC has growth ahead of them which makes this stock worth a lot more than what the ticker shows right now. If you do not need the money - for sure, let this ride for the long run - you WILL make money.  


Charts & More:  
Volkwagen did the same thing as what AMC is doing now. It almost went back to the previous low before it shot up. Do you think Hedge Fund's weren't in the same boat then as they are now? They will try to tank this as much as they can, until they cannot hold on anymore. Eventually, they will pay.  


A $2m dollar $20/call bet was placed the other day. This is an extremely good sign, provided this investor knows something. I don't know about you, but if I were going to wager a $2m bet that this stock was going to be $20 or above by end of February, I'd have done my homework. Based on this alone, I believe this says there is a greater chance that it will, than wont, be $20 or above come end of Feb.  


So, my fellow retail investing friends, the game here is patience. HF can play all the dirty tricks they want but eventually they will break. They cannot afford to be patient, we can. REMEMBER THIS.... AND... HOLD HOLD HOLD!!! PLEASE cut & paste and SHARE EVERYWHERE!!!!",0.109183044,0.397123961

This can give those, who do not want to get involved financially, to still support us, and we create a fund that will help us win this fight and spread the tendies around too.

(They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, its unlikely that its anyone at all.

I feel like there are a ton of new and confused traders in here so I'm going to help explain what's happening...

Gamestop (GME) and (AMC) are two failing companies who's stocks got a bump in the market due to some recent good, but ultimately inconsequential news. That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.

(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)

This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.

A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).

As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their position. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.

On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their positions by buying stock which will cause AMC, EXPR, and GameStop to sky rocket.

That is why you BUY NOW (apply pressure and start your investment) and HOLD. Because every person that sells is relieving the pressure and reducing the billions of dollars the hedge funds will owe us, the little guys.

The price will go up, and it will go down, just buy it and hold it at LEAST until Friday 1/29.

These short sellers have played with our lives for years, now it's our time to take back.. what they have snatched from our brothers and sisters.

Now it's time to make AMC to 150$ and GME to 1000$

Shorts will start reacting when AMC will reach 50$ as it happened in case of GME.
So, it's a very good time to enter in AMC, I'm already in with 150k. I have done my part.

Gamestop (GME) and (AMC) are two failing companies who's stocks got a bump in the market due to some recent good, but ultimately inconsequential news. That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.  


(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)  


This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.  


A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).  


As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their position. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.  


On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their positions by buying stock which will cause AMC and GameStop to sky rocket.  


That is why you BUY NOW (apply pressure and start your investment) and HOLD. Because every person that sells is relieving the pressure and reducing the billions of dollars the hedge funds will owe us, the little guys.  


The price will go up, and it will go down, just buy it and hold it at LEAST until Friday 1/29.  


WHY AMC IS DOWN AFTERHOURS: Hedge fund managers, Short sellers, and Market Makers are using their extended hour trading to scare retail traders (You) off. Most retail traders (You) lack the ability to trade before and after the market opens/closes. This is why it is currently down. Once retail traders (You) are able to get back in at market open tomorrow, this will again go up. This is an attempt to scare ppl away from the stock. It will happen every single evening for the next several days so be prepared for this. If it is to stressful for you, please put away your phone/computer and check again in the morning.

hy the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: Take a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on. Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as f\*\*\* trying to make us lose!!! Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not f\*\*\* dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. Also, AMC just paid back $600m of their debt they raised! In an even better position than before because of US. room for both squeezes, lets go boys.

5951,1/30/2021,4:52,1/30/2021 4:52,glbjia9,1612000347,"Just sharing from Yahoo - AMC conversation room

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

&#x200B;

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because its going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at its highest.

I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but its all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what youre dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.

Happy trading, GREAT job today everyone. And dont forget to share this or copy and paste it along other post to spread the word! Ill see you on the moon  ",0.124715458,0.471111111

Not everyone needs to set limits this high because there are far more shorts than there are longs but it will help if everyone here did. This means that AMCs stock price could be $20 but if we have limits at $1,000 they have no choice but to buy at that limit, turning 1 share into $1,000 Bad news: The shorts are massive institutions which much more buying power than all of the retail investors Good news: Because AMC finished more than 10% down today, the SSR rule is in place, meaning for all of tomorrow no one will be allowed to open any new short positions.

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

HOLD
Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because its going to violently rise
Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at its highest",0.10190917099999999,0.460326279

6727,1/28/2021,8:54,1/28/2021 8:54,gl20jv3,1611842040,"Why the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: 

Take a look at this link ( https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme

If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on.

Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!!

Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. There's room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

AMC current status (01FEB2020):

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire this week or next. So we MUST hold beyond that.

The target this past Friday (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting would be at come today) and that was done. It closed at $13.29 -- AWESOME sauce. This short will expire today.

So when they're forced to cover ($8.63) today they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn't even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts at 1 - 2 days away (Tuesday) or (Wednesday). What does this mean? The longer WE hold, the higher the price gets and the more money they have to cover. Do I need to explain further?

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a violent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains today are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be MUCH higher.

Short squeezes are historic. TO give you an example when VW did this, it has a 46% short and a $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 08. AMC is at 84% short -- the % is significantly higher and there is a lot more room for it to grow. On the high end we're talking the possibility of hitting $150-$200 A SHARE IF EVERYONE IS SMART AND HOLDING UNTIL THURSDAY.

My recommendation:

1.	BUY
2.	HOLD
3.	BUY MORE
4.	HOLD & ENJOY THE RIDE

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96.

On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

8003,2/1/2021,18:09,2/1/2021 18:09,gllu081,1612220988,"NASDAQ publishes a report on short positions twice af month. According to sources who has acces to this report, the hedgefond holding AMC shorts (15. january estimated 41%, others on reddit have said 62%, and maybe even more at this time), a unknown percentage of their short was set at 9$, which is why it was important to close above that last friday. This short is said to run out today - meaning they will have to pay 0.25% of each stocks price each day onwards in rent. A lot when AMC currently is at 15-17 dollars a stock, and they are holding 52 million of them (estimated 27. january). Furthermore 37% of the floating stocks (floating means available for trading and therefore shorting), is owned by institutions who doens't sell their position to the hedges. If we put these numbers together: 100%-37% = 63% left for the shorters to buy back. And they need to buy back between 41-62%, making it almost a 100% effectively at best. Which means that we, the retail investors, effectively have the power to drive the price up potential 40-100$ (some say more, personally im skeptical). Along the week, more of their short positions will run out, making it for an even more expensive short, and then the big squeeze will begin. Maybe late-week, maybe next week.",0.132,0.378666667

To anyone worried about GME going down alot It's clearly the hedge funds selling off thier stock trying to create a frenzy of sell offs (just check the volume of trades) But it's not working because we all keep buying the shares they're selling which is bringing the price back up But obviously they are 1 organised entity, so they can plan their sell offs to make them seem like real people/multiple people are selling, but in reality it is clearly just a very very very small percentage of share holders actually selling(the hedgefunds) Also the hedgefunds can't keep selling their stock or eventually they'll run out and be in an even shitter position when the shorts get squeezed Expect a huge drop today(market manipulation)(followed by a huge recovery) and the huge drop will be their hail mary attempt when they try to scare people into selling, just don't fall for it and we'll crush them!

AMC FACTS: Where did anybody say this was going to the moon not only today.... but this morning at that? the market literally opened for the week and the hedge funds have most of the week to cover their positions that they were out of the money on from Friday. Here I will lay it out for your idiots.... They had until Friday to close below $8.63. They didn't do it. We closed at 13. Which means we won. The next part is now they have this week to cover those contracts. Which means they have to buy them until Friday at the latest. Some of those they have to buy by Wednesday. Apparently you guys dont understand how options contracts work. They closed out of the money on Friday now they have the next several days to fulfill their contracts and going to repurchase their shares to return to their lender. Do you think they're going to purchase them all right now? Obv. not...That guarantees them a loss. They're going to try everything they can to push the price down between now and that time they have to repay. In the meantime the clock is ticking. The longer we can keep the price trading sideways the more they get squeezed at the end of the week and price starts going up as they inevitably have to start buying. They're just trying to buy themselves time. This was never going to the moon Monday. It was going to trade sideways as its a battle between US and THEM. The clock is ticking on them not us. All we have to do is keep it sideways for the next couple of days by buying and holding. NOT SELLING.

I This is a re-post. Thanks to Brandon for putting on the AMC board. Its applicable for us as well.

KEY POINTS: (Please read) Like to keep as Top Conversations so ALL reads. (UPDATED)

1.	Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the ""cause"" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.

PATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.

2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying ""lets get this to $30"" or ""let get this to 100"". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.

3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video >>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY

4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc

Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.

	They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.

1.	Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.
2.	Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.
3.	Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.
4.	What is short selling: >> https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp
5.	Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp
6.	Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.
7.	Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.
8.	Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.

AMC FACTS: Where did anybody say this was going to the moon not only today.... but this morning at that? the market literally opened for the week and the hedge funds have most of the week to cover their positions that they were out of the money on from Friday. Here I will lay it out for your idiots.... They had until Friday to close below $8.63. They didn't do it. We closed at 13. Which means we won. The next part is now they have this week to cover those contracts. Which means they have to buy them until Friday at the latest. Some of those they have to buy by Wednesday. Apparently you guys dont understand how options contracts work. They closed out of the money on Friday now they have the next several days to fulfill their contracts and going to repurchase their shares to return to their lender. Do you think they're going to purchase them all right now? Obv. not...That guarantees them a loss. They're going to try everything they can to push the price down between now and that time they have to repay. In the meantime the clock is ticking. The longer we can keep the price trading sideways the more they get squeezed at the end of the week and price starts going up as they inevitably have to start buying. They're just trying to buy themselves time. This was never going to the moon Monday. It was going to trade sideways as its a battle between US and THEM. The clock is ticking on them not us.

Where did anybody say this was going to the moon not only today.... but this morning at that? the market literally opened for the week and the hedge funds have most of the week to cover their positions that they were out of the money on from Friday. Here I will lay it out for your idiots.... They had until Friday to close below $8.63. They didn't do it. We closed at 13. Which means we won. The next part is now they have this week to cover those contracts. Which means they have to buy them until Friday at the latest. Some of those they have to buy by Wednesday. Apparently you guys don't understand how options contracts work. They closed out of the money on Friday now they have the next several days to fulfill their contracts and going to repurchase their shares to return to their lender. Do you think they're going to purchase them all right now? Obv not...That guarantees them a loss. They're going to try everything they can to push the price down between now and that time they have to repay. In the meantime the clock is ticking. The longer we can keep the price trading sideways the more they get squeezed at the end of the week and price starts going up as they inevitably have to start buying. They're just trying to buy themselves time. This was never going to the moon today. It was going to trade sideways as its a battle between US and THEM. The clock is ticking on them not us. All we have to do is keep it sideways for the next couple of days by buying and holding. NOT SELLING. Then you're going to see 50+ 100+ if you guys don't understand how this works then what are you even doing here...,-0.019990078999999997,0.44216269799999997

They had a week to cover their contract. They have the latest till Friday but some of these contracts have to be bought by Wednesday. They have the next few days to cover their contracts and theyre going to re-purchase Their shares to return to their Lender. The hedge funds arent going to buy them all back at the same time because that would guarantee them a loss. So theyre going to pretend to short sale by selling the stocks to each other making the market look as if theres a huge sale of the stock bringing down the price. Between now and Friday theyre gonna do everything they can to try to drive down the price between now and when they have to repay. Misinformation is a part of the game. So as a group of individual investors the idea  is to purchase everything that we can and hold passed their (the hedgers) limit. The longer we can keep trading sideways the more the hedges get SQUEEZEDr at the end of the week, and the price of AMC starts to rise as they inevitably have to buy it back. The stock wasnt going to hit the moon in one day and the clock is ticking on them not us all we have to do is keep holding and everybody else who can purchase can keep purchasing & keep this thing going sideways over the next couple of days.

The hedge-funders have a week to cover their position. You see they had until last Friday to close at $8.23 but we close at $13. so we won the first battle. 

 Now they have a week to cover their contract. They have the latest till Friday but some of these contracts have to be bought by Wednesday. They have the next few days to cover their contracts and theyre going to re-purchase Their shares to return to their Lender. The hedge funds arent going to buy them all back at the same time because that would guarantee them a loss. So theyre going to pretend to short sale by selling the stocks to each other making the market look as if theres a huge sale of the stock bringing down the price. Between now and Friday theyre gonna do everything they can to try to drive down the price between now and when they have to repay. Misinformation is a part of the game. So as a group of individual investors the idea  is to purchase everything that we can and hold passed their (the hedgers) limit. The longer we can keep trading sideways the more the hedges get SQUEEZED at the end of the week, and the price of AMC starts to rise as they inevitably have to buy it back. The stock wasnt going to hit the moon in one day and the clock is ticking on them not us all we have to do is keep holding and everybody else who can purchase can keep purchasing & keep this thing going sideways over the next couple of days. We can see the stock soar and decide whens a good time to sell. It is possible to see this go into the hundreds.",0.065694444,0.378888889

This means that AMC's stock price could be $20 but if we have limit sells at $1000 they have no choice but to buy at that limit turning one share into $1000 dollars. Because AMC finished more them 10% down today, the SSR rule in in place meaning for all of tomorrow and no one will be allowed to open any new short positions.",0.05342312,0.293714927

hy the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: Take a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on. Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!! Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. Also, AMC just paid back $600m of their debt they raised! In an even better position than before because of US. room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

1. Bot brigade negative sentiment on social media, reddit, etc. (this has yet to be common and could be more prevalent soon - though I have seen some new made accounts posting negative sentiment on GME)

2. Buying up the shares we don't have, driving up the price...
a) Hoping to create more liquidity for them by reducing our shares (more defectors as price goes up). 
b) So they can accumulate shares and manufacture large sell offs on volume to create what we saw earlier today

3. Persuade investors on reddit, social media, etc. that there are other better things to buy that will fuck shorts. Yes, there are plenty. But they want to spread us thin. BB, AMC, etc. are just the beginning. If we sell some of our shares to allocate to these and more that will be mentioned over the next couple weeks, we will lose. We will lose not only our strength in GME, but our strength in any focus of any short squeeze.

This is a war. We won the first battle and now they know we mean business. But we haven't won the war. They are going to pull shit that we won't see coming. We will be tested and this will not be easy. But we need to understand that if we persevere through this, we will not only come out rich for our early endeavors (because it's still early in this squeeze) but we will have power in bringing about actual change in the way large funds manipulate prices and how they manage risk.

explanation I found- of How their options contracts work:
The hedge-funders have this week to cover their position. You see they had until last Friday to close at $8.23 but we close at $13. so we won the first battle. 
Battle 2 yesterday, not the best but this was predicted to slump.
 Now they have a week to cover their contract. They have the latest till Friday but some of these contracts have to be bought by Wednesday. They have the next few days to cover their contracts and theyre going to re-purchase Their shares to return to their Lender. The hedge funds arent going to buy them all back at the same time because that would guarantee them a loss. So theyre going to pretend to short sale by selling the stocks to each other making the market look as if theres a huge sale of the stock bringing down the price. Between now and Friday theyre gonna do everything they can to try to drive down the price between now and when they have to repay. Misinformation is a part of the game. So as a group of individual investors the idea  is to purchase everything that we can and hold passed their (the hedgers) limit. The longer we can keep trading sideways the more the hedges get SQUEEZED at the end of the week, and the price of AMC starts to rise as they inevitably have to buy it back. The stock wasnt going to hit the moon in one day and the clock is ticking on them not us all we have to do is keep holding and everybody else who can purchase can keep purchasing & keep this thing going sideways over the next couple of days.

PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday",0.12089781699999999,0.44286706299999995

Read info dummies god damn read this

It will eventually surge upwards. Let me explain Hood their options contracts work.
The hedge-funders have a week to cover their position. You see they had until last Friday to close at $8.23 but we close at $13. so we won the first battle. 
Battle 2 yesterday, not the best but this was predicted to slump.
 Now they have a week to cover their contract. They have the latest till Friday but some of these contracts have to be bought by Wednesday. They have the next few days to cover their contracts and theyre going to re-purchase Their shares to return to their Lender. The hedge funds arent going to buy them all back at the same time because that would guarantee them a loss. So theyre going to pretend to short sale by selling the stocks to each other making the market look as if theres a huge sale of the stock bringing down the price. Between now and Friday theyre gonna do everything they can to try to drive down the price between now and when they have to repay. Misinformation is a part of the game. So as a group of individual investors the idea  is to purchase everything that we can and hold passed their (the hedgers) limit. The longer we can keep trading sideways the more the hedges get SQUEEZED at the end of the week, and the price of AMC starts to rise as they inevitably have to buy it back. The stock wasnt going to hit the moon in one day and the clock is ticking on them not us all we have to do is keep holding and everybody else who can purchase can keep purchasing & keep this thing going sideways over the next couple of days. We can see the stock soar and decide whens a good time to sell. It is possible to see this go into the hundreds",0.07790404,0.394444444

When the number hits 0, they have to pay! The further it moves away from zero, the longer this goes on or even risks not happening. Imo, this is the only number that matters. Not the price, the ratio to when they have to sell. 

How do we push this number down? By holding and buying more. This is literally the only way. The short ladder attacks push this number back up, as do any sales back into the hands of HF. As an indicator, the ratio this time last week was 1.44. WE HAVE HALVED THAT NUMBER IN ONE WEEK. If we continue at the current rate of buying and holding, in one weeks time or less, WE WIN.

We helped save a business we all love. And if a squeeze doesn't happen (and it might not), consider holding out until AMC fully recovers. If you can.

The hedge-funders have a week to cover their position. You see they had until last Friday to close at $8.23 but we close at $13. so we won the first battle. 
Battle 2 yesterday, not the best but this was predicted to slump.
 Now they have a week to cover their contract. They have the latest till Friday but some of these contracts have to be bought by Wednesday. They have the next few days to cover their contracts and theyre going to re-purchase Their shares to return to their Lender. The hedge funds arent going to buy them all back at the same time because that would guarantee them a loss. So theyre going to pretend to short sale by selling the stocks to each other making the market look as if theres a huge sale of the stock bringing down the price. Between now and Friday theyre gonna do everything they can to try to drive down the price between now and when they have to repay. Misinformation is a part of the game. So as a group of individual investors the idea  is to purchase everything that we can and hold passed their (the hedgers) limit. The longer we can keep trading sideways the more the hedges get SQUEEZED at the end of the week, and the price of AMC starts to rise as they inevitably have to buy it back. The stock wasnt going to hit the moon in one day and the clock is ticking on them not us all we have to do is keep holding and everybody else who can purchase can keep purchasing & keep this thing going sideways over the next couple of days.

The hedge-funders have a week to cover their position. You see they had until last Friday to close at $8.23 but we close at $13. so we won the first battle. 
Battle 2 yesterday, not the best but this was predicted to slump.
 Now they have a week to cover their contract. They have the latest till Friday but some of these contracts have to be bought by Wednesday. They have the next few days to cover their contracts and theyre going to re-purchase Their shares to return to their Lender. The hedge funds arent going to buy them all back at the same time because that would guarantee them a loss. So theyre going to pretend to short sale by selling the stocks to each other making the market look as if theres a huge sale of the stock bringing down the price. Between now and Friday theyre gonna do everything they can to try to drive down the price between now and when they have to repay. Misinformation is a part of the game. So as a group of individual investors the idea  is to purchase everything that we can and hold passed their (the hedgers) limit. The longer we can keep trading sideways the more the hedges get SQUEEZED at the end of the week, and the price of AMC starts to rise as they inevitably have to buy it back. The stock wasnt going to hit the moon in one day and the clock is ticking on them not us all we have to do is keep holding and everybody else who can purchase can keep purchasing & keep this thing going sideways over the next couple of days. We can see the stock soar and decide whens a good time to sell. It is possible to see this go into the hundreds.",0.110185185,0.375132275

 Let me explain How their options contracts work. WITH ******INFO I FOUND HERE
The hedge-funders have a week, THIS WEEK to cover their position. You see they had until last Friday to close at $8.23 but we close at $13. so we won the first battle. 

 Now they have a week to cover their contract. They have the latest till TOMORROW but some of these contracts haD to be bought by Wednesday. THATS WHY WE SAY POSITIVITY ON WEDNESDAY. They have til TOMORROW to cover their contracts and theyre going to re-purchase Their shares to return to their Lender. The hedge funds arent going to buy them all back at the same time because that would guarantee them a loss. So theyre going to pretend to short sale by selling the stocks to each other making the market look as if theres a huge sale of the stock bringing down the price . WHICH IS WHAT THEYVE BEEN DOING. Between Wednesday and tomorrow, theyre were doing everything they can to try to drive down the price between now and when they have to repay. Misinformation is a part of the game. So as a group of individual investors the idea  is to purchase everything that we can and hold passed their (the hedgers) limit. The longer we can keep trading sideways the more the hedges get SQUEEZEDr at the end of the week, and the price of AMC starts to rise as they inevitably have to buy it back. The stock wasnt going to hit the moon in one day and the clock is ticking on them not us all we have to do is keep holding and everybody else who can purchase can keep purchasing & keep this thing going sideways over the next couple of days. We can see the stock soar and decide whens a good time to sell. It is possible to see this go into the hundreds.",0.084104938,0.415432099

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it",0.12849206300000002,0.43152194200000005

It only looks like the stock is selling off, ini reality, its not. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isnt. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).

Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, its unlikely that its anyone at all.

18727,2/1/2021,20:26,2/1/2021 20:26,glmfo3z,1612229166,"PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday",0.12089781699999999,0.44286706299999995

Where did anybody say this was going to the moon not only today.... but this morning at that? the market literally opened for the week and the hedge funds have most of the week to cover their positions that they were out of the money on from Friday. Here I will lay it out for your idiots.... They had until Friday to close below $8.63. They didn't do it. We closed at 13. Which means we won. The next part is now they have this week to cover those contracts. Which means they have to buy them until Friday at the latest. Some of those they have to buy by Wednesday. Apparently you guys don't understand how options contracts work. They closed out of the money on Friday now they have the next several days to fulfill their contracts and going to repurchase their shares to return to their lender. Do you think they're going to purchase them all right now? Obv not...That guarantees them a loss. They're going to try everything they can to push the price down between now and that time they have to repay. In the meantime the clock is ticking. The longer we can keep the price trading sideways the more they get squeezed at the end of the week and price starts going up as they inevitably have to start buying. They're just trying to buy themselves time. This was never going to the moon today. It was going to trade sideways as its a battle between US and THEM. The clock is ticking on them not us. All we have to do is keep it sideways for the next couple of days by buying and holding. NOT SELLING. Then you're going to see 50+ 100+ if you guys don't understand how this works then what are you even doing here...,-0.019990078999999997,0.44216269799999997

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when its time to close the positions of shorted shares and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short position will have to close in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  And, who can forget our grandson GME? 

AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because its going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when shorts have to close their positions and as a result of that they themselves take the price higher.

More by u/Common-Buy-2379 in comment section:

AMC is also 49.85% owned by a Chinese holding company. This company controls over 75% of voting shares indirectly, through controlling interest in subsidiaries that also own shares.

They will NOT be bailing out the hedge funds, which would dilute their ownership in the company. They will not be floating their shares for sale during the squeeze.

In all likelihood, the upcoming stock issuance will be sold to larger firms with little interest in assisting the hedges, and will probably remain within Chinese control.

Not financial advice, I just read the 10-k, 8-k, and 10-q, because I like this stock. Also tendies. I love tendies.

To illustrate, If the Chinese owned shares aren't available to fill the shorts, then there's only 13M shares to fill the 44M shorts.

It's WAY shorter than people think.

Positions: 

- 1700 AMC shares balls deep @ 18$ average (~30K)
- 6c AMC 19/3 (10 contracts)

Edit: Earlier I had shorts expire in this post which seemingly drew some people crazy ignoring other important aspects. I meant to say when shorts will have to cover their positions. Edited in post.

KEY POINTS: (Please read) Like to keep as Top Conversations so ALL reads. (UPDATED)

1. Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the ""cause"" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.

PATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.

2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying ""lets get this to $30"" or ""let get this to 100"". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.

3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video >>> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY)

4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc)

Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.

 They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.

1. Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.
2. Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.
3. Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.
4. What is short selling: >> [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp)
5. Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference.

6. Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.
7. Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.
8. Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.

18904,2/2/2021,4:02,2/2/2021 4:02,gloavom,1612256545,"WALL STREET PLAN - Trying to psychologically scare you with MANIPULATED BIG DIPS and then a SMALL recovery. They want to MAKE YOU DOUBT, that the NEXT BIG DIP, you couldve SOLD at Recovery. This has been going on since Thursday for GME & AMC

Everyone,

TIME is the enemy of Wall Street. Theyre running like a chicken with no head. They have to COVER and pay INTEREST!!

AS LONG AS YOU HOLD AND DONT SELL, those big dips are NOT REALIZED LOSSES! Theyre just psychological losses to make you DOUBT AND SELL!

Brokers restricting PURCHASE of these stocks is creating an UNFAIR ratio of SUPPLY and due to the restriction of stock it creates a LOW DEMAND! Therefore when theres a big supply and low demand is when the stock price goes down. However, there is A LOT OF DEMAND and thats why theyre playing DIRTY and restricted purchase to CREATE A FAKE LOW DEMAND! Thats why there are lawsuits. 

1) HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS

2) DONT LET WALL STREET BULLY YOU

3) AS DAY PASSES WALL STREET CONTINUE TO BLEED since they have to cover and pay interest

4)HOLD AND BUY

5)REMOVE YOUR STOP LOSSES

6) SET LIMIT AS HIGH AS YIU CAN

7) DO NOT LOCK IN GAINS because you want to BUY DIPS. With the restriction, this strategy is not plausible

8) AMC/GME ruled out bankruptcy so your stock wont be $0

9) DOUBLE CHECK any news or analyst or posts as they may try to scare you with fake facts. Do your own DD

10) think positive of the BIG REWARD. You CANT lose more than your total investment but  GAINS ARE LIMITLESS and this is whats SCARING wallstreet. (Example if you invested 10k, all you would lose would be 10k but could be walking away with 100k, 1 million , 10 million depending on the resilience of all of us to BUY AND HOLD)

11) Check (barstool el presidente) David Portnoys videos where he simplified and explains the illegal shit wallstreet is doing. Gotta love this man",-0.067122027,0.46933365899999996

They're just trying to buy themselves time. This was never going to the moon Monday. It was going to trade sideways as its a battle between US and THEM. The clock is ticking on them not us. All we have to do is keep it sideways for the next couple of days by buying and holding. NOT SELLING.

On Monday the stock price will go up in the opening and people will start selling once they see they have made some profit.

If we all sell, the big investors will take advantage of this and the war will be over, they will win. If we keep strong and hold positions they will attack and not be able to put the stock down, like on Friday. We need to keep purchasing AMC and hold. If we make this happen, during the week AMC will skyrocket to the moon and we will leave with the pockets full.

FINAL DECISION IS ON US! STAY STRONG AND HOLD! 

UPVOTE SO THAT EVERYBODY SEE THIS!

P.S: fix your limit sell order over $500 or as high as your platform allows. This is what the shorts use to take decisions.

KEY POINTS: (Please read) Like to keep as Top Conversations so ALL reads. (UPDATED)

1.	Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the ""cause"" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.

PATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.

2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying ""lets get this to $30"" or ""let get this to 100"". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.

3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video >>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY

4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc

Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.

	They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.

1.	Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.
2.	Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.
3.	Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.
4.	What is short selling: >> https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp
5.	Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp
6.	Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.
7.	Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.
8.	Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.

I hope this helps many.",0.122599206,0.5114726629999999

GME was great but it wasn't publisised as much beforehand as much AMC is, AMC has gone mainstream with people all over the world even celebrities on board not just redditors. Also at GME's peak they were restricted by criminals like robinhood trying to stop them buying stock. Hopefully by now people have found other ways to buy instead of being limited. So we have far more people on board, we won't be limited by what we can buy and 86% of the stock is shorted so all this means we could see huge gains once the squeeze kicks in. Next week could be epic! It only took 3 days for GME to go from 40 to 460 a share so let's see where we end up  ALL WE NEED TO DO IS BUY & HOLD AND WE GO TO THE FUCKING MOON!!!!

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because its going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at its highest""",0.10190917099999999,0.460326279

(They attacked Robinhood, attacked wsb, attacked reddit. BUY THIS DIP)

So there has been a huge effort on the behalf of the shorts to mislead everyone. There idea is to misdirect. They said they got out of their short positions but the float is STILL 138.4% and the stock only got to 365 in AH where it's easy to manipulate price. For reference, AMC is 36.58%, Telsa is 8%.

GME is 138.4% they doubled down and are trying everyway to distract you to other stocks. My guess would be they are the ones pumping up AMC because they know most Robinhood users can do anything unless they sell their GME positions. They NEED your shares to get out of this jam. If you sell, you give them the ammo to do it. People are asking is the squeeze over? The squeeze didn't even start yet by the look of it.

They want you to run over to some other short positions. They figure if all of us take profits today they will accumulate enough shares to tank it and shake out the weak paper hands giving them more ammo.

If you hold and don't touch your commons. You will be part of the largest squeeze and transfer of wealth in history. The fed caused this by this extra liquidity which allowed greed to run rampant. This isn't our fault they double down and never took profits. The greed that was allowed on their behalf was insane here. 138.4% short. This is life changing money for many of us. Myself included. I could pay off debt, student loans, have money for my kids college.

Diamond hands. Buy every dip.

They are trying to distract you with AMC, BB, BBBY. Telling you the squeeze is over when they actually doubled down. They think we are idiots, let's show them how smart it is to double down against people with very little to lose in comparison to them. Don't worry, they will just get a government bail out and do it again. This is our time people.

Don't listen to anything I say. I'm not a financial advisor, I eat crayons and gather facts from a memes

Point 1. Wanda selling in blocks allows hedges to cover their shorts. I can see the first one of 15mill for profit.

If Wanda is selling blocks, it allows hedges to buy to cover their short loans and have stock on hand to dump on the market to bring the price down to make their short call. 

The only prevent to this would be if retail brought the majority on float to market.

This theory would eliminate the current trade in synthetic short stocks.

Wanda floating stock percentage is more in line with lowering liability risk in a low price stock (going to the moon though) - same as everyone saying dont sell all your shares on the rise to cover your cost and keep the hedges bleeding, only do 25% that I have seen going around.

Point two - if AMC, Wanda, and SEC are working together to make a situation of an active crime available and an option - That probably would be classed entrapment in the eyes of the law. 

Take away SEC and you just have bullish trading (which is probably more realistic)

>4th and Goal (how it ends):  
>  
>On June 2nd, AMC has to finish their share count so they can disseminate materials. Adam Aron has already stated he will make the share count public. When he announces the total shares counted, it will clearly show the blatant manipulation and illegal activities.

As I understand it, **June 2nd is when the share count will BEGIN**, not end. The share count happens when they disseminate the voting materials and votes begin coming back. **The vote IS the share count**; it's not some separate event.

From the AMC press release (emphasis mine):

>Company Release - 5/4/2021  
>  
>LEAWOOD, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) today announced that its Board of Directors has postponed the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders that was previously supposed to be held today. The date change will provide additional time for its millions of current individual shareholders to have their voices heard and more time to cast ballots on important shareholder matters. The Annual Meeting has been rescheduled for July 29, 2021, and **a new record date of June 2, 2021**, has been established for stockholders entitled to attend and vote at the meeting. **The Company will deliver a new notice of the Annual Meeting to stockholders as of the record date, who will need to resubmit their votes, even if they have previously voted.**

It may be very close to June 2nd that enough shareholders have voted that it becomes clear that there are a bazillion more shares out there than the company issued, but it might also take a while. The date that Adam Aron communicates what they learned from the vote, or that any other action happens based on this meeting, could be any date from June 2nd all the way up to the meeting date of July 29th.

If I am mistaken, I am happy to be corrected, but everyone looking to June 2nd as a magic date could create a lot of expectation, which as the Buddha has been trying to tell us, leads to disappointment.

Just truly evil shit that theyre trying to do, and if it is true I hope they know that theyre going to hell.  Trying to drive a struggling into the ground for personal gain is already awful, but doubling down and trying to destroy other businesses as well by trying to get people to rally against them is pure evil.

By spreading FUD against all these movie producing companies theyre trying to tank the price of AMC indirectly because theyre all linked through ETFs.  

The absolute worst and most reprehensible act that theyre doing is attempting to hurt the bottom line of revenue they collect.  Covid was bad and everyone suffered, but these guys are trying to drive the price of other companies down just because they cant pay their debt on amc and gme.

I don't follow what you're saying. 

If you're referring to people canceling their subs we don't get to tell people what they are and aren't allowed to sub to and why. Disney and Netflix have been bleeding subs well before this in response to their woke ideology being forced into their programming, their cancel culture and putting out irresponsible garbage like Cuties. Not to mention making a movie in a Chinese concentration camp then publicly thanking them for the ""pleasure"". 

If you're saying people are shorting them there's every chance they believe they deserve it for the above reasons. And it's not remotely the same as AMC. They are likely to recover just fine they won't tank. 

I happen to still be subscribed to both because, despite being unhappy with the above, I still enjoy some of the content, wish to view it and support the people producing that content. 
But if Disney and Netflix want to sort out their bleeding subs it's on them to fix their problems and get back to focussing on just producing good TV. Perhaps then they can gain positive sentiment that will be reflected in their share price.",0.038552189,0.41872895600000004

The waiting has paid off. I've been holding on to my AMC shares for a good for a good while. I knew AMC will go up since the dumb hedge funds have not paid back the shares they shorted.

28975,5/19/2021,8:51,5/19/2021 8:51,gynsul2,1621428698,"For the new to catch up on the AMC/GME story, here is my 2 cents interpretation of what I see.   
The Stock Market is basically a Prey hunting trapping game and as I see it goes like this:  
The big guys goes on scavenger hunt and then they zero on a prey target. The company needs to have some interest in their stock. The hunters start to throw foods on the road to attract the prey to dip their toes in the water and have some confidence their shares are growing.  
Increasing the share prices would increase investors (prey) attraction to invest more.   
Then the hunters ask the Market Manipulators to create huge amount of Put options and Call options to make them gain/loss neutral and cover their tracks.  
  
Then the Hunters lend the synthetic shares they created and the short selling begins not at high volume yet, because the goal is to keep selling as much as investors prey keeps on buying. The Prey collects the sold money to grow even larger and more powerful to replicate the plan with other stocks and continue to repeat the trap.  
  
Once they decide that the prey eat enough shares and trapped, hunters flood the market relentlessly of those synthetic shares that appears legit since it is backed by Option put/call. Certainly, some borrowing of the real shares take place as well as that is also part of the trap cover-up to deceive the prey.   
  
Part of the decoy system are Media Bashers, false news manipulators, buying and selling outside the market Blackpool out of shore tradings, fake analysis, bought/bribed regulators and authorities etc.   
  
In short, provide unlimited supply to achieve the target goal of the most favored outcome of driving the company to bankruptcy or at the most to purchase the borrowed and synthetic shares at a much lower rate than the fund collected selling them. Then the regulators may fine the Manipulators a very tinny percentage as a punishment which is tinny skin out of the entire prey.  
  
So historically, the smart prey try to interpret charts and fundamentals which basically buys when the enemy is looking the other way or when the enemy is setting the crumbs on the road to trap the prey then as soon the big trap gets closer, sell and sheer the profit.   
  
Another Prey coping tactics has been is to buy options as much as they can afford to lose and for a short chance.   
  
Another prey coping mechanism is that when they get trapped to return bleeding with broken hopes accepting that this time they miscalculated and go on with less goals in life.  
However, this time is different. The prey decided to turn into Apes and bond worldwide against their aggressors. Apes now start eating the dangled food the aggressors left on the way with courage. Apes realized all food anywhere can be turned into a hidden trap and cost them to get hunted swiftly and decided to focus on one GME and AMC trap food the aggressors set for them. Now the prey trapped the aggressor not as a form of becoming a new aggressor, but as a duty and a right to defend ones own life, family and belongings against the aggressors even if it means bankrupting the aggressor and even jailing them as they have committed robing and stealing in the trillion of wealth against the majority of the people of good well everywhere.   
  
Because the aggressors have done it over and over with great success, Apes must tough it out and stand their ground against the aggressor with resolute.   
  
Now, for me as long as the aggressors are covering with new synthetic shares is not the squeeze at all. The real squeeze is when the manufacturers of the synthetic shares are forced to purchase them at any price the seller determined and born those synthetic shares and every borrowed shares there is. Uncovered borrowed share is a naked share that dilute the market and loot investors.  
  
This is my opinion and not any financial advice as all I see is a game of hunting",0.093353948,0.420749459

Personally I'm someone who used to always go to the movies and I just have no more taste for it, but that has more to do with holywood more than it does to do with movie theaters.  I don't live in big cities but given how much content the big companies like Disney is pushing on their online stores (Disney+ with Marvel and WB content on HBO Max) which I have been keeping up with it just seems that movie theaters as they once were would find it hard to find that market value.

I would think 15-16 sound about right with a board that has a vision for post-covid world with streaming becoming big (someone was saying instead of big theaters selling just movies doing some sort of deal with gamestop to experiences to smaller groups of people with simulated big screens of whatever kind of entertainment).

I just haven't heard what they plan to do and I don't see any movie lineup this summer that is going to pack any theaters and sell concessions like it used to.

The share expansion is a moot point in 2021, unless Adam was fibbing and I don't think he really wants to reverse course after making such a strong case in his recent interview.

I would expect if he makes any comment on this is, it's going to be along the lines of, its clear Shareholders don't want the expansion at this time. I promised them I wouldn't use any of such shares in Calendar year 2021 anyway. We don't ""Need"" to use any currently or in the forseeable 2021 future.  We can always revisit this when conditions, needs and objectives of the company have changed. It isn't needed currently.

Just my thoughts.  Not financial or any other sort of advice.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  The Board has reserved the right to reintroduce the proposed share expansion at any time in the future.  (I would have done the same thing, honestly)  I think this is a good thing and removes the possibility of creation of a divide between Shareholders of AMC and AMC's leadership.  Sometimes share dilution is necessary but Adam already firmly indicated that it isn't needed now or going forward in 2021.  So why push the issue, imo.  He and the Board appear to be yielding to Shareholders stance on this.  Also a smart move.

I had millions - literal millions - of shares of that company. I didn't mind that they were issuing shares to raise capital, because I figured they were going to use the opportunity provided them to make a big move to be able to come into reopening with a real jolt. Maybe a $PLAY acquisition or at the very least a partnership. Use the time to retool their operations to an all in one entertainment option of some sort instead of the tired old model of $20 movie tickets and overpriced chicken sandwiches.

Instead, executive leadership used the money to hand themselves fat bonuses for ""saving"" the company when they literally didn't do anything but let the share price be elevated on sentimentality and meme status and act like they had something to do with it.

Then they asked to issue even more shares. No vision. Just cashing in and using the company like an ATM.

So I voted no. Millions of times. Then spent a few days unwinding my position. The company is dead to me. I don't know why anybody would invest in them. They had an entire year to come up with ideas on how to grow their operations or make a move, and they literally just collected their paychecks and raided the company coffers.

Thank you for the post to remind/inform folks about what happened and what was going on at the time. Just some additions from my perspective:

I was new to stocks around September last year and I was frequenting WSB. I remember that there were rumors that GameStop was trying to transition to e-commerce and that the stock was possibly undervalued. Also some random dude decided to yolo his money on that transition (DFV). Also, some dude from Chewy bought in and became a major holder of GME (RC). Honestly, at that time, I thought it was all fucking crazy. I naively thought that GameStop was failing. Of course GME started gaining steam end of last year before spiking in January. I actually bought an option 11/19/21 $25 call in December. At the time, I thought it was a bet on maybe GME making a turnaround after 2021 Q2 earnings. I still have that call 

Also as we all probably know, WSB is all about options with the gain and loss porns being popular. I do distinctly remember that the play for GME was actually not call options, but buying shares because when the squeeze was in possible, no one knows when it will occur. 

Finally, when the January squeeze happened, I remember that people were looking for other squeeze possibilities. As I remember people saw a bunch of stocks that were shorted. Then I think people FOMOd on GME by investing in BB, AMC, and NOK. Although I think there was some DD about BB turning it around based on a partnership with AMZN. 

Anyway, Im just agreeing that GME was the original play based on the e-commerce turnaround which became a short squeeze play and that AMC, as I remember it, was always a secondary play of a possible short squeeze after the GME squeeze in January.",0.004454545,0.542515152

Theyre not going bankrupt, theres pent up demand for movie theaters, the CEO is likeable and knows what hes doing, and they have a cult fanbase now too.

Do I think its as shorted as GME, has as strong fundamentals or as big a play? Hell no! But their sub is confident that retail owns over 100% of AMCs float. Most gme apes are like me and own a bit of AMC. Both will squeeze imo, but no one here is selling gme for amc so you all can please stop making these posts. 

Maybe because I havent seen the amc talk in superstonk youre referencing, but to me all these anti-amc posts come off as conveniently timed FUD for AMC apes while AMC looks to be starting a gamma squeeze. They read SuperStonk posts too",0.15666666699999998,0.600555556

Get multiple brokers and consume and purchase and hold as much amc as you can we are about to take off... if you dont get in on this opportunity right now you will miss out on these discounted prices of AMC and GME. It was very important for us to hold the line. We cant let them win. They are very desperate right now. With the legal lawsuits with robinhood they are now tied down.... this is in our favor!!! The squeeze can happen now if we all work together... trust me on this! The patterns are similar to the GME and Volkswagen in 08 pattern.... please hold just trust me on this!

The problem is even if we see that GME and AMC are still the #1 and #2 most shorted stock, if the price hasn't already rocketed by then, it means the short squeeze will never come because the institutions are willing to burn money to outlast us.

35281,1/29/2021,23:12,1/29/2021 23:12,gla7pkx,1611979932,"quick explanation for AMC:

The hedge funds sold call options on AMC up to $9. If the price closes above 9 today, those options will get exercised and the hedge funds will be on the hook to provide 100 AMC shares for each option contract sold. Therefore they will have to buy back at market prices to provide those shares.

this will compound the upward price movement (called a gamma squeeze). The higher AMC closes today, the larger the positive effect. Additionally, short interest on AMC has gone up 13% this week (71% -> 84%) meaning they are doubling down on their short. If we can gamma squeeze today (keep price above 9), then the short squeeze will soon follow.

REMEMBER, THE NAME OF THE GAME IS PATIENCE. HOLD AND DON'T LET THEM WIN THEIR SHADY GAMES.

Why would people want to go to the movies you ask? (Movie theaters have always done well during recessions if you are concerned about the future, AMC  should be valued around 30$ or more due to inflation; yet the stock is only about 1/3 of that at the moment). 

I bought some AMC at 18; if I can buy in and hold at 18 then you can buy in when its low and watch the gains come in and flow like water! (Thank me later). 

We are going to take AMC, GME, BB, and NOK to the moon! Dont panic, never sell low! I know youve heard this a million times.. HOLD!!

(Buy low, sell high) ... well we arent selling though just yet, we are holding tell these hedge funds fold and we get the funds we DESERVE. Law suites and congress hearings are INCoMinG.

Well, millions of people have been waiting for some the movies that are coming out this year for DECADE(s), 
-Top Gun 
-Avatar 2 (made billions and set records)
-Dune Reboot 
- Matrix 4 
- Cinderella 
- 101 Dalmatians 
- Spawn Reboot 
- Venom 2 
(This is just a few of them) (100s of millions have gone into these movies and guess what they make money, ALOT of it) .. especially the opening week/month in theaters!

Today we have gotten so much publicity (the publicity we got today showed us the hedge fund managers put all their cards on the table, risking jail time for blatant stock manipulation). These hedge fund companies got swallowed alive on Twitter today). They even lost more money on GME despite all of their efforts to destroy it today! 

If ANYONE knows the power of social media its Reddit. WSB has gone up millions of new users;  many new retail investors are coming in to join the war and get on the  to the  !! 

GME, AMC, BB, NOK  (the war just started) and this is far from over; so, tonight is the night where we get ready for the battle tomorrow for our precious Diamonds! Get a little rest and eat some food if you can!! Be mentally vigilant tomorrow! dont get paper hands if you see some high dips; this is the time to buy more and fuck the hedge funds; their strategies as you already know are FUCKED (they have some secret tricks up their sleeves, but so do we)... buy those dips and fuck them where it hurts! 

In all sales jobs we would have a rally with the team before the day to get everyone hyped up! Lets get hyped up this morning guys! Together! Everyone do your part on social media and the comments, if millions of us do we we are just giving ourselves more publicity! We *HOLD* and buy on the dips! 

It was so nice seeing Congress, Celebs and lots of other high profile people being on the retail investors side! 

PS - Psych 101 - you never tell someone they cant do something ie. You cant buy but you can sell (reverse psychology is real) however, this was the only hand the hedge funds could play to keep from loosing everything today.. telling people not to buy is just going to make them want to buy more, and more. DONT BE AFRAID, we are in this war together. We may not win every battle, but we WILL win the war ! Too much publicity not to at this point. See you guys on the moon.

GME is an earthquake. It's going to lay some serious fucking damage down and the epicenter is, let's say it's off the coast of Seattle. Some serious waves are going to hit the coast there.

But those waves travel the other direction also. Once the waves in Seattle have calmed down and everyone's panic and hysteria is over, the panic and hysteria will just be hitting Japan in the form of a big ass tsunami, and that tsunami is silver. You don't get the tsunami without the earthquake.

Silver is itching for a big move for awhile now. Just like DFV made his initial play on GME way the fuck long ago while the rest of us laughed at him, these moves take time and the earlier you're in the better. Silver isn't an overnight thing. If you don't want to fuck with it, then don't. Hold your GME forever or sell it tomorrow. Nobody that matters gives a shit. If you do give a shit about the moves someone else is making then you're simply using them for your own personal gain and you're no different than the HFs.

There's just as many new accounts shilling GME and AMC as there are silver and their goal is _put us at odds with each other_.

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because its going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at its highest.

36204,2/1/2021,9:27,2/1/2021 9:27,glkkdis,1612189636,"tldr: Hold your AMC until at least 200. Selling before then will just ruin it for you and everyone else. Today was a victory, but the war has just begun.

Today was an important step in the right direction, and a huge victory for us. AMC closed today at $13.26, much higher than the $9 dollars needed to close the call options in our favor. This means that there simply is not enough shares that the hedge funds can buy to cover their shares. WE WON THE BATTLE.

THE WAR IS NOT WON HOWEVER. The longer we hold our shares, the longer the hedge's will not be able to cover their shorts, and the more the fee's the hedge's will have to pay for not covering their shorts. Eventually, they will be begging us to sell them our shorts. IT IS UP TO USE TO HOLD OUR SHARES. WE MUST WORK TOGETHER. IF WE START UNDERCUTTING EACH OTHER, WE WILL ALL LOSE OUT.

HOLD YOUR AMC SHARES UNTIL AT LEAST $200 A SHARE. THE LONGER WE HOLD, THE HARDER THE GAMMA SQUEEZE. AT 200 WE WILL DECIDE IF WE HOLD AND PUSH FOR HIGHER NUMBERS OR IF WE SETTLE (MOST LIKELY WE WILL HOLD FOR MORE). Remember, the longer we hold, the more the hedge fund bastards will have to pay in fees. We will rinse them out.

HOLD YOUR AMC. DO NOT SELL. DO NOT FALL FOR THE HEDGE'S SCARE TACTICS. THEY WILL SHORT LADDER, PASS FAKE NEWS, WHATEVER THEY CAN TO SCARE YOU INTO SELLING. WE WILL HOLD OUT. DIAMOND HANDS. SET YOUR SELL LIMITS TO 200. WE WILL SHOW JUST HOW STRONG WE ARE TOGETHER. 

This may take a few days. Maybe even a couple weeks. Just look at $GME. But we stand together, and we rise.

Melvin Capital doesnt have shares to gobble up (their private and dont have shares; they have LPs), and Melvin was not short GME in any size. They had a tiny put on GME, which expired last week and no more. Melvin didnt get margin called either; they were facing redemptions and got whacked on their long portfolio which was in a bunch of illiquids. Pt72 and Citadel entered into a revenue sharing agreement, which you NEVER do in a teetering fund. You do that when you expect the fund to outperform.

Source: work at hedge fund and know all of these people. Every hedge fund of size runs a counterparty desk and their sole job is to know exactly whats going on at other banks/hedge funds (your counterparties) - Pt72 and Melvin are telling all desks they are/were fine and this whole thing is kinda funny and weird. Melvin is down for the year, but nowhere near 30% on a gross AUM basis.

And if you really want to argue, go find the source of the rumor that Melvin is short GME. Theres a single 13F from Nov 2020 that shows a $50M GME put....and nothing more. Short positions dont show up on filings, and nobody would know unless Melvin published their short, but that hasnt happened. So where is the source of this rumor? Find it - I dare you. I know news sites are reporting it as fact, but I literally had a reporter from a major financial news outlet asking me if I knew where it came from. I told the reporter, you know were all laughing about this....

Theres no short squeeze - this is a pure-play mania and it will end just like past stock manias....badly.

Lastly, if you dont know how 1) a stock can have 110% short interest and still have a net long exposure, 2) how an individual fund can be short a stock and simultaneously net long, youre gonna get fucked when this corrects.

-

Look at melvins Nov 13F filing. They absolutely had a $50M put, which is a flavor of a short position. That put expired worthless on 1/22. So they told the truth. But my point is that $50M in a $20 billion portfolio is nothingness and definitely wont squeeze shit. GME is trading like $20B to $30B per hour.

This is part of the reason that wall st is laughing: to trigger a squeeze, you need a huge short position relative to the daily volume traded. So if a stock has $10B of shares shorted and trades like $1B per day, thats a great set up for a squeeze. Why? Bc there are not enough shares being traded for a fund to cover their position, so they have to bid up the market to induce more selling supply. Stock price goes up more, and thats a squeeze.

On the other hand, GME is trading the entire short float multiple times per day. Theres simply no way for a squeeze to happen mechanically - there are waaaaaaaay too many shares openly being traded to make it difficult for a fund to cover their shorts. GME is one of the most liquid stocks on the market today. Theres no there there.

-

NO HEDGE FUND HAS TO BUY IN THEIR SHORTS EVER. WSB has no fucking clue whats going on in reality.

The short interest right now is either 1) options dealers hedging the insane number of puts outstanding (and/or any synthetic positions out), and 2) it is trivial for a sophisticated hedge fund to have a short position in a stock and be net long (profiting when it goes up). In fact, the few funds playing this right now are doing precisely that. Point is, THERE IS NO GUARANTEED SHORT SQUEEZE and no fund is on the clock - hedge funds can work their balance sheets until WSB is a smoldering hole of tendies turned to ashes.

And as for this AMC thing, this is literally hedge funds taking money from WSB - they flipped the converts, and guess who bought it....WSB. Im sure they send their thanks while they are in private planes down to Barbuda.

Whats about to happen is trick the system, it is illegal but you stand to lose a couple million in a lawsuit vs billions in your bad shorting stocks. 

The hedge fund hatches a plan. Market markers and hedgefund friends are going to use stocks that they own and trade them very very quickly with each other at low low prices. The supply is still low, they are only trading a couple hundred or thousand stocks, but the system cant recognize that its the same stocks being traded. Its just seeing the amount of times the same stock is being traded. So one stock being moved 5 times the system, sees as 5 different stocks, and therefore think the supply is high. 

Thing is, this only drives the price down. It doesnt matter though, since you as someone who is holding isnt selling at that price. It doesnt matter what the price is at if no one is selling. See, the price decrease because the same stocks are being traded constantly tricking the system into thinking its multiple stocks being traded once, however since the price is too low for the people who are holding the other stocks they are not selling. The supply is still low. 

Why is this important? It is important because the hedge funds need to buy your stocks to close their positions. They literally cannot close their shorts unless they buy your stocks. This is why you are supposed to hold your stocks, no matter how low the price is. The price is a facade, they want you to sell at a price they are setting. If you are not selling even though the price is low, they cant buy. If they cant buy, they cant close their shorts. If they cant close their shorts, theyll have to pay interest. And if the interest becomes too much, they are going to be forced to buy your stocks at whatever price you offer. This is the squeeze. 

The squeeze starts when the hedge fund cant afford to trick the system anymore since the interest on their shorts are getting too much. Theyll have to pay whatever we ask of them. If no one sells until 1000usd, they are going to be forced to pay that. If no one sells until 10000usd, theyll have to pay that amount instead. When they are forced to close their positions, they will flood the marketplace with orders to buy. This is going to skyrocket the stocks, and the price will keep rising until people start selling. However, if you sell during the short ladder attacks, the squeeze wont happen. The price set during the attacks isnt the actual price. Its the price thats tricked into the system. 

This is why you HOLD no matter how much the price goes down. If everyone holds, there is no supply and if there is no supply it doesnt matter how low the price is SINCE THERE IS LITERALLY NO ONE FOR THE HEDGE FUNDS TO BUY FROM so they cant close their positions, theyll have to keep paying for the interest and at some point, they WILL have to BUY YOUR STOCKS no matter the price.",-0.001936508,0.399793651

It's explained, very easily, and without much digging.  Both stocks were targeted by hedge fund short sellers so greedy they left themselves vulnerable to a short squeeze. Smart intellectuals at /r/wallstreetbets (the smarter-est) saw this vulnerability and memed and hyped redditors into buying and holding GME and AMC so hard that that the shorts will be squeeze to bankruptcy.  
  
Then, this week, the shorts doubled down on it!  They took loans from another hedge fund to cover the shorts!  That was when gamestop was near 100.  Now gamestop is at 350 (meaning the shorts just lost another 200% of the money so far), and a new massive squeeze just over the horizon.  On Friday, all the options become due.  And given the current price of the stock, millions the options are ""in the money"" where normally they would be worthless. Which triggers forced buying of shares to from everyone who was shorting the stock through options.  How much?  I think something like 20% of the total available gamestop shares are required to cover it.  And the buying by WSB (wallstreetbets) ate up almost all the available shares to buy.  Which means they *might* have to buy stock at 3x, 4x, 10x? times the current price.

I don't particularly love any corporation; I'm suspicious of their wealth and influence. That being said, I absolutely hate the idea of a group of super-millionaire hedge funders bankrupting a company with 4000 employees for funsies, just as a matter of course. These guys aren't checking their bank accounts to ensure they can take their wives out to the movies on Friday night. They aren't passing up popcorn because it's a little expensive. They are removed entirely from the institutions we value, the rules that we follow, and the lives that we lead.

AMC may fail because of streaming services, or dumb marketing decisions or disputes with Universal - but by God, I'll be damned if they fail and 4000 lose their jobs because a global pandemic wouldn't let us go to the movies and a couple hedge funders saw a chance to ruin something

Now this poster is brilliant. Read it understand it pass it along. PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because its going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at its highest.

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow.

Look at the Open Interest (OI) column, this indicates the total number of option contracts that are held by investors in active positions. The Volume represents the number of options contracts being exchanged between buyers and sellers.

There is a huge drop off in options contracts below $15. If BB closes tomorrow below $15, then all these contracts will expire worthless. If BB closes above $30 tomorrow, then all these contracts will be ITM and Wallstreet will have to fork over a pretty penny to pay these out. They are manipulating the stock for their benefit.

Edit: Getting a lot of private messages about this, If you have to ask which option you should buy tomorrow, just buy shares. This is just my person opinion and not professional investment advice.

Edit 2: For those asking if we don't hit $30/$20/$15 today, still hold your positions. Wall Street is trying to scare us into selling. The higher the price today, the maximum the pain to their wallets, but this stock trends with GME/AMC. Once they go up we go up. The squeeze is not over!

One potential good catalyst is if GME / AMC resolves and people take profits, people here will want something to roll their profits into.  BB is one of the stocks on WSB and can be seen as a lot more stable, so it might be a boon for all of us.

AMC is just as heavily shorted and the movies are as equally important as a common man institution as video game stores. And I have my fucking reasons you petulant fuckface. 

1. I love the fucking movies and I reject bankruptcy motivated short sellers who will kill the employment of thousands of people. I reject them, I reject them, I reject them.

2. The principle behind GME is also an attack on inequality through a rejection of our current manipulative financial system. Short selling is not just 75% bullshit, during a pandemic its 150% blood-seeking. Does anyone really believe AMC was headed into immediate bankruptcy without the pandemic.

3. I am an AMC member and continued paying my monthly rate even when AMC was shut down by the pandemic. Why? Because I support businesses I believe in.

I buy Apple, Disney, Microsoft, and a whole bunch of businesses because I believe in them. I also buy AMC because I believe in it.

I love the movies, AMC is near me, and I want it to remain in the area. 

4. I want PRIVATE CAPITAL to give a shit about SOCIAL CAPITAL. In 2008, the public bailed out Wall Street for absolute fraud. And then the banks made obscene money and delivered huge bonuses.

So why can major financial institutions invest in the things that will prop up businesses? Why shouldnt they fucking want to? Why do we need to keep inflating our currency by printing money as a means to prop up the already wealthy?

Why can I scream right back in their face and say STOP BEING AMORAL FUCKS  and Bet On The Recovery that working people need. Bet directly on working people.

This is why I am LONG AMC AND GME.

And fuck the op for his judgmental self-righteous ass-hattery. 

5. Most importantly, AMC is heavily invested in by the movement. You can suppprt it for be left behind. You are welcomed to join but dont tell people not to who believe in the cause. If you do that, then youre know better than CNBC that keeps reporting GME will lose steam, Jim Cramer who recommended that everyone just stop, or Robinhood who restricted my purchase of buying AMC just as much as GME purely because WE WERE WINNING.

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.
2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.
3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.
4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.
5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.
6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.
7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that [/u/draemon\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/draemon_/) provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

Jim Cramer himself, [""here's what short sellers do, it's illegal but when you have 6 days to get out and you're down you need to foment and wipe that guy out quickly"".](https://youtu.be/VMuEis3byY4)

**This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. (THANKS for this info,** [/u/blancochocolate](https://www.reddit.com/u/blancochocolate/)**)**

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.\*

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU,** [/u/catolicquotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/catolicquotes/)

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are forced sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or prop desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing volatility**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated dumps of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.

The same goes for GME  ",0.11723424699999999,0.43323472799999996

I do have a real investing account. I got into gamestop on the 2nd dip at 5 shares average $47. I also bought a little AMC. I bought in so I could initially invest $350 seed money and grow it quickly. Then I would learn how to properly research and DD.

Robinhood has gone against the fiduciary duty of its market client base, along with his companys motto of democratizing finance for all by participating in market manipulation. Robinhood has banned the purchase of several NYSE listed equities securities including GME, AMC, BB, and NOK. This is a mockery of the United States foundational characteristic of free markets. Clearly, Robinhood, along with other similar broker dealers, have no interest in the free market or for individual investors. Rather, they serve the interests of hedge fund corporations who have most likely persuaded these firms to engage in market manipulation in order to mitigate losses enacted by short selling.

The corrupts at wall street have had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Trying to create hype about silver to distract us, using their media contacts to distort the narrative, scaremongering... has it worked? Fuck no!

What they are now doing is using a reduced form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. In other words they will continue to trade between themselves at a level that will keep the stock stagnant. This will be a futile attempt to deceive us that the game is up (excuse the pun) and that the squeeze is over.

People, the squeeze is just getting started! It has barley begun! They will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our stock.

They are continuing to drive the price down now aftermarket in attempt to create further panic so that people sell tomorrow. This is exactly what they want. DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!

HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART; No matter what people say, what you hear in the media or any other form of bullshit distraction...

THEY CANNOT CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS UNLESS WE SELL. Simple as that. Its mathematics. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares. Bottom line.

They cant get out of this without buying the shares back. And who controls the price at which the buy back? WE DO!

Everyone just take a step back, chill out, block out the noise and absolutely 100% hold every bit of stock you own. We are winning here. It really is that simple.

If everyone can stay cool and follow this advice, we got this.

The corrupts at wall street have had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Trying to create hype about silver to distract us, using their media contacts to distort the narrative, scaremongering... has it worked? Fuck no!

What they are now doing is using a reduced form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. In other words they will continue to trade between themselves at a level that will keep the stock stagnant. This will be a futile attempt to deceive us that the game is up (excuse the pun) and that the squeeze is over.

People, the squeeze is just getting started! It has barley begun! They will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our stock.

They are continuing to drive the price down now aftermarket in attempt to create further panic so that people sell tomorrow. This is exactly what they want. DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!

HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART; No matter what people say, what you hear in the media or any other form of bullshit distraction...

THEY CANNOT CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS UNLESS WE SELL. Simple as that. Its mathematics. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares. Bottom line.

They cant get out of this without buying the shares back. And who controls the price at which the buy back? WE DO!

Everyone just take a step back, chill out, block out the noise and absolutely 100% hold every bit of stock you own. We are winning here. It really is that simple.

If everyone can stay cool and follow this advice, we got this.

Please upvote, share etc. Dont care about karma or anything this is far more important. The message needs to be spread so that we can do whats necessary and finally get ours. Weve spent too long being oppressed by this corrupt system. Its time for change.

GME & AMC are the main focus. Anything else is a distraction.

LETS DO THIS!!!

I slept in a recliner up until my family was evicted. Walmart moved to my hometown and closed the surrounding stores including the local $GME. Then the Walmart went out business and the city is fucked.

I made it out by taking nearly 100k of student loans and I have a pretty good life other than the student debt. Then I get married, moved to a town with a beautiful $AMC right around the corner. 

GameStop, my childhood store to line up at midnight and buy halo 2 with my life savings, was crumbling due to these dick sweaters. 

Now AMC is struggling to survive, all with their dine in options, beautiful comfortable recliners and 4K projectors. Yes a worldwide pandemic happened, but worse? The billionaire thumb riders jacking off hard to business failures. Businesses that bring joy to many, so they can be even more rich while everyone else loses joy-opportunities. 

So first off fuck Walmart, fuck these pig dick licking billionaires for fucking our house from us several moons ago, and fuck the media for making it seem like we did something wrong.

This morning Im going all in on AMC and GME. I hope at least someone reads this and gets inspired like I did after lurking for so long. Seems like a lot of us retards got hit in similar ways. Time to take the power back! Power to the players! I got sharp AF  and I dont give a fuck. 

Lets hold the line boys.

MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WILL READ ALL DAY: $AMC:

Its  unlikely anyone here is selling. This is a short ladder. It only looks  like the stock is selling off, ini reality, its not. Hedge funds sell  back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid  succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off  when there actually isnt. (They do this to scare off retail investors  to engineer a sell off).

Once the  attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand.  Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip  away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so  if retail investors are selling, its unlikely that its anyone at all.

They are blatantly manipulating the market

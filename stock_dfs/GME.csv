\-DFV told congress and the entire nation during the last hearing he still thinks GME is attractive at then-current price and outlined why(opportunity for pivot, once industry leaders in gaming, etc.).

\-They didn't believe him, so with steel balls a'swinging he doubled down and bought 50K more shares of GME

\-Yesterday Gamestop CFO resigned, which is excellent news because he's part of the old guard that almost let Gamestop fade into non-existence. New CFO will be more in line with new vision of RC and gang.

\-SI report will come out tonight, and it will probably show the same as what we've been seeing with short interest and number of shorted shares, which bodes well for the prophesized MOASS. Yes the report is 2 weeks delayed, no its not super reliable, blah blah we know, but its still news.

\-Conan O'Brien tweeted yesterday that he FINALLY gave in and bought some GME stock, which is good publicity and lends to the positive momentum!

There's probably more driving this but thats all I can think of right now

As the price goes closer to $60, delta gets closer to 1 so they buy more shares at prices lower than $60 so they dont lose their ass. As more MMs buy to cover their hedge, momentum picks up, buying intensifies and now youre in a gamma squeeze where you have a ton of MMs buying to hedge their positions.

They were then immediately loaned out again shortly after open which lowered the price back to $43 almost instantly. Over the next few hours it went back up to $45. The move to $45 was all retail. Whichever hedge fund tried flipping those 100,000 shorts is currently losing money AND retail traders now own that stock. Retail is gaining control over more and more of the GME float. 75% of them are losing interest and paper handing as soon as they realize it's not going hyperbolic yet, but the 25% of  who intend to hold are gaining ground. The more retail owns, the more they control the price they're willing to sell it for. They have gained a ton of ground the last few days even if it doesn't look like it on the price. Retail is becoming aware of this and yesterday morning, when 100,000 more shorts entered the market they were bought up almost immediately. You can see that event as the two giant candles at opening yesterday. We'd gain ground a lot faster if people quit lying and saying ""it's about to moon! Here we go!""

Nobody knows how long it'll be before it moons. The longer it takes the higher it'll go, as long as upward pressure is maintained, and retail buys hedge fund shares at a discount when they're lent into the market.  need to understand this and help all the  retards FUDing about understand it too. Enough people are holding for a squeeze, but if more people understood what's really going on we could get the upward pressure we need to trigger it.

Watch this chart like a hawk. When borrowed shares are sold, Buy them. That's how we win.

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME

Additional details

If you look at the chart at that link you'll see the number of shares available to borrow rose from 1 million to 1.1 million in pre market monday; then back to 1 million shortly after open. 100,000 short positions were covered and then immediately re opened. However, there was also 800,000 additional shares that were made available to borrow at 11:30, but those weren't the result of shorts being covered. We would've seen an insane spike in the price if that was the case. Some whale must've just simply decided to make their shares available to borrow. DFV's 50,000 share purchase, resulted in a 5% spike in price on Friday; 100,000 shorts covering in pre market caused a 13% spike Monday, and a 13% dip that immediately rebounded Tuesday. We're now beginning to get a clearer picture on the mechanics of this stock and it's better than anyone thought. Interestingly, it actually doesn't look like there are any whales involved on retail's side anymore. Turns out retail really has been holding the line this entire time. All they have to do now is snag up those discount shares when they're lent into the market.",0.143478261,0.42569875799999995

**THIS IS NOT EVEN THE SQUEEZE YET, PATIENCE AND DIAMOND HANDS REQUIRED**

The price shot up massively yesterday, true. But we also saw volume spike, and two giants that were dumping and instabuying everything. Now ofcourse everyone is excited, I get it.

But I think its essential to remember this

**A short squeeze is when the price goes up due ENDLESS demand for a stock in a market situation where supply is low.**

In a shortsqueeze there is no limit on the price. Its like a nuclear runaway reaction. Read again. Endless demand (because they overshorted more than 100% of available stock in case of GME). New FINRA data 60% (which is HIGH btw) but its with shitloads of shorts hidden in ETFs like XRT.

**This is NOT what is happening now.**
The price now is going up because of buying. That means the moment they stop buying is the moment the price stabilizes or FALLS. In such an event it is unwise to panic. Its not ending, you didn't miss the squeeze, you're not holding the bag. Calm down 

**Its just that the price was going up because of something different than the squeeze.**

UNTIL THE SQUEEZE HAPPENS THERE WILL BE NO RIDICULOUS HIGH PRICES AND THE PRICE MIGHT EVEN DROP DRAMATICLY. THIS MEANS THE SQUEEZE HASNT STARTED YET, NOTHING MORE. DONT BE A 14 YEAR OLD THAT SHOOTS HIS JIZZ BEFORE THE PLAY EVEN STARTS.

**THE PRICE CAN GO UP OR MASSIVELY DOWN IN THE COMING WEEKS EVEN. AS LONG AS THE SHORTS HAVENT OR COULDNT HAVE COVERED THE SQUEEZE WILL COME.**

Dont panic if the price goes down, remember the fucking DD. You did read DD right? You didn't just blindly jump on a bandwagon which will prevent you from understanding whats happening? Preventing you from making good decisions in a unique market situation? No? Good.

&#x200B;

Literally shaking with anger at TD Ameritrade right now.

I'm diamondhands on GME. My husband is learning stocks. He bought at high. Wanted to set a small limit order to sell just a few shares for 350, and keep his other shares. We need the money, so I told him go ahead.

Went on TD Ameritrade. Limit order rejected over and over and over. He asked me to look at it. Got that ""significantly higher than current share price, please confirm that this is the correct security"" message. So I called TD AMERITRADE. Stuck on hold for half an hour. Finally ""Mason,"" answers.

General Summary of our conversation:

""Hello, my husbands limit order keeps being rejected. Can you tell me why?""

Mason: Well, it's significantly higher than the current share price.

Me: But it's pretty near the price at which my husband purchased it. So it seems reasonable.

Mason: If you place a limit that high, it's probably never going to get filled.

Me: That's fine. It's my money. It's my choice. If it doesn't get filled, that's fine by me. My money, my decision. So, can you place the limit order for me?

Mason: No.

Me: Okay . . . what limit order am I ""allowed"" to place?

Mason: \*hesitates\* It has to be within 100 points.

Me: Can you just tell me the number? What is the share price that I'm ""allowed"" to set for a limit order?

Mason: $150 is the max.

Me: That's disappointing, because I have a limit order several thousand on the same stock onetrade. So I guess I no longer want to do business with Ameritrade.

Mason: (clearly upset) Why? Why would you WANT to place a limit order that high if it's never going to get filled? It's completely unreasonable!!!

Me: Well, GME hit 350 in premarket this morning so it doesn't seem unreasonable at all to me.

Mason: ......

&#x200B;

Sooooo . . .  there is no free market. Your money. Your taxes. But you're not allowed to choose your own limit orders. How is this legal? Is this legal? How is this still going on?

And why are you allowed to buy at 350, but not to sell at 350?

I was like, yea that sucks guess I'll just have to hold onto it for fucking ever and maybe one day I can get my money back. I was down so hard. I do not have money. I am a poor motherfucker and I yolo'd everything I could spare. 150 dollars. Into GME. I borrowed another 70 from a friend just so I could get 2 at 110. And I honestly didn't care if it took off or not. I simply wanted to watch wall street sweat and be a part of the movement that shed light on the shady shit that goes on there. I was totally prepared to watch it ride to zero and just count it as the cost of revolution. So I've held this whole time. I considered averaging down at $43 but I really couldn't afford it if it tanked further so I didn't.

I was one of the late joining bag holders. It took me a while to get my fidelity account setup and ready I wanted in before Jan 27/28 but couldn't get my funds approved and transferred and settled before then. This is giving me hope again. Hope that I'll recoup my investment in addition to the exposure that came from this which was my real reason for getting into it. Yea I wanted to make some money too but, I'd never considered stocks before this. Thank you retards so much for all the posts these last weeks. I lurk here and read and rarely post.

I feel like there are a ton of new and confused traders in here so I'm going to help explain what's happening...

Gamestop (GME) and (AMC) are two failing companies who's stocks got a bump in the market due to some recent good, but ultimately inconsequential news. That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.

(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)

This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.

A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).

As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their position. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.

On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their positions by buying stock which will cause AMC, EXPR, and GameStop to sky rocket.

That is why you BUY NOW (apply pressure and start your investment) and HOLD. Because every person that sells is relieving the pressure and reducing the billions of dollars the hedge funds will owe us, the little guys.

The price will go up, and it will go down, just buy it and hold it at LEAST until Friday 1/29.

hy the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: Take a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on. Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as f\*\*\* trying to make us lose!!! Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not f\*\*\* dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. Also, AMC just paid back $600m of their debt they raised! In an even better position than before because of US. room for both squeezes, lets go boys.

Quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the Bulls and Bears  Corporate America being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Apes must seem of little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted among the very wise.

In fact, it has been remarked by some that the Apes' only real passion is for Bananas. A rather unfair observation, as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of juice, and the smoking of crayons. But where our hearts truly lie is in peace and quiet, and good tilled DD. For all Apes share a love of Stonks that .

And yes, no doubt, to others our ways seem quaint. But today, of all days, it is brought home to me, it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

Together, Ape Strong

**8:30 Pre-Market Update**

GME does not care that the markets have closed. While the North American Apes were sleeping, the Europan, Asian, Australian, and African Apes continue to fuel the , pushing GME's price to around 285. It has since leveled out around 277.

[Some apes are speculating that Short Interest compared to the Float may still be over 200%.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/) Available shorts according to [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) show that there are 850,000 shorts available. This number will be updated at around 9:04 with this morning's short activity. According to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/), there are 45.16 million float shares. Regardless of what the actual Short% is, I feel confident to say that there are still too many shorts still outstanding and that GME's momentum should continue. Those shorts must be bought eventually, and the Apes will decide how much they will sell their  for.

* Shorts available: 850,000

* Price at Close: 246.90

* Current Pre-Market Price: 277.74

**9:07 Pre-Market Update**

500,000 shorts were opened premarket. This might explain why premarket prices are around 266. Don't be surprised if there is a dip at the start of the Bell.

* Shorts available: 350,000

* Current premarket price: 266.63 (corrected)

**10:12 Update**



The North American Apes follow the rest of the world Apes into a frenzy. 500,000 did nothing to slow GME's ascent and is continuing it's upward trajectory. The Short Hedge Investors and Traders (SHITs or SHITers) are in serious trouble as the Apes continue to demand more and more for their stock. The growth has been exponential and there is no end in sight. 

* Shorts available: 350,000

* Current price: 290.82

**Update 10:51**

A small 50,000 sedative short shot was injected into the Apes, which took the stock below 290 for a small bit. After being dazed for a bit, the Apes have continued their rampage, demanding the price go above 295. Upward momentum is still in full force, though it might not be as strong as opening bell. Once the shot wears off, we might see another climb.

* Shorts available: 300,000

* Current price: 294.00

**Update 11:25**

Welcome back onboard $300 Apes. It is truly a beautiful sight to see Apes band together and care for one another. The apes continue the climb, eyeing Apes left at 400 and beyond. What an incredible story for the Apes. You don't see this kind of community with Bears or Bulls. Apes truly care for one another and want nothing but  for all.

* Shorts available: 300,000

* Current price: 305.96

**Update 12:07**



They used 50,000 shorts, but Apes don't care. GME is nearly $100 ahead of where it ended yesterday and it's showing no signs of slowing down. GME might break 400 before EOD.

* Shorts available: 250,000

* Current price : 340.26

**Update 12:23 Halt**

That was strange. This is where I wish I knew how long shorts borrowed have until they enter the market. Remember how they borrowed 500,000 prior to opening bell? I wouldn't be surprised if all those were just fired at GME in a coordinated attack. This also happens during lunch? Seems suspicious to me. We'll definitely have more information as time goes on, but this is definitely a strange development. We'll see how GME reacts after the halt.

GME just exited the halt and things are volatile. Please buckle up and hold on tight. 

* Shorts available: 250,000

* Current price: 276.00

**Update 12:31 Halt #2**

Holy shit. We're at another halt. This seems like a really desperate attempt to cut off the GME fuel. I don't think anyone legit believes that drop was natural.

* Shorts available: 200,000

* Current price: 248.68

**Update 12:36 Halt #3**

ANOTHER HALT! GME is now down 30 from where it ended yesterday. The SHITers need to do something drastic and this is it. They're trying to get people to panic sell. They're trying to get people to leave their position. I don't think anyone is buying it though. This is so clearly manipulation.

*Shorts available: 200,000

*Current price: 216

As a young investor, just starting out in my career, just starting to really invest, I have passively researched and slowly learned the basics about the Greeks, value trading vs growth, dollar cost averaging. 

But none of it really ever sunk in until I found WSB and decided to pick the bug from my fellow apes head and take a bite. My first bite was to FOMO GME at $350. My portfolio crashed, like everyone else, and while I was 80% down, I didnt sell. I listened, I read, I learned. 

I found out about FUD. Wow. Like really, media is not on my side. They tried to say that you all were playing me and making me a bag holder. You said, , were coming back for you. For whatever reason, that comradely from strangers broke through the BS that was popping up on my news feed and made me dig deeper. 

I learned about the MACD, and about averaging down. I got my GME under $100 and then just buckled up and enjoyed life.

TODAY, for the first time since I opened my account, I'm at a profit. Of $100. On GME. I made an extra $100 on the money I initially invested.

To bigger apes, this is nothing. It's pocket change. But to me, it's a revelation. It's a sign that, if I play my cards right, I *might* be able to afford a house in about 10 years.

TL;DR at the bottom for those of you who can't read.

Robinhood makes most of it's money selling information on customer orders.It sells a lot of this information to Citadel LLC.That's the same Citadel who just bailed out Melvin Capital.

Yesterday we saw a targeted attack by hedgefunds and big money, targeting stop losses and sell orders. These motherfuckers are using Robinhood, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other brokerages to find your stop losses, tank the stock, and trigger widespread sell-offs.

>*""Chicago-based Citadel Securities accounts for 40 of every 100 shares traded by individual investors in the US, making it the number one retail market maker, according to Piper Sandler. The company is a big buyer of customer trades from the leading US retail brokerages such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, which have slashed commissions to zero to keep up with fast-growing challengers such as Robinhood.""*[*https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b*](https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b)

You're basically leaving everyone vulnerable by having a stop loss, because Citadel and Mevlin, and the other assholes will target the largest stop losses, to trigger a huge sell off, which then tanks the stock enough to hit another huge stop loss point and trigger another huge sell off, and so on, and so on. That's why the stock suddenly went from $150 to $80 in the space of an hour.

Despite all that, and their shady manipulation, Melvin Capital needed a bailout, and the stock still ended the day up 16%. **WE'RE WINNING.**

We saw this stop loss tactic yesterday, and it will happen again today, and the rest of the week too.

We were millennials just out of undergrad, so the 2008 downturn crushed us the hardest.  I had many friends who lost their jobs as well, and they had to choose between paying for crushing amounts of student loans, rent, food, or for healthcare (this was before Obamacare remember).  Needless to say, 2008 did a number on many of my friends' credit scores, and they are still trying to dig out of debt because 2008 fucked them royally since banks piled on fees and late penalties to people who couldn't pay off their student loans due to job loss.   And to top it off, Wall Street got billions in bailouts from taxpayers while no one went to jail for 2008. 

Fuck all of these assholes.  Pay back is a bitch.  You think we all forgot what these ahole elitists did during 2008 and the sweet bailouts they got while the rest of us suffered? Fuck no.

1) Remove your stop losses, ur brokers arent ur friends, they are closer to the MMs and the shorts. They will see ur stop losses and try to trigger them.

2) Do NOT and I repeat do NOT be excited when we start going up. I know it's very hard to control urself when ur making more money in 1hr than you've seen in 6 months BUT. if u cant maintain mental strength, when u start seeing that amount go red, u will paper hand and sell. You will be helping the shorts as not only u give them shares but u help them FAKE a dump to make it look like people are running for the exits.

3) Start looking for patterns. After halts we start to drop then we go back up. I recommend tradingview.com to see charts properly. a TRADING HALT DOESN'T MEAN THE STOCK IS CRASHING just relax and breathe.

4) If you are new to the sub and have not experienced your account or the account of others being wiped out (hello RKT gang) buy in and close ur app till atleast 1pm if you know u cant control ur paper hands.

5) Expect dirty af tactics from shorts. We can only speculate what the $2.7 billion bailout will be used for. Perhaps after today we will have better insight so if something seems irregular dont be scared.

6) I love u all but PLEASE stop posting ur positions. These are $20 billion firms with educated employees(no not u guys who work behind Wendy's) and as speculative as this might be, we KNOW they are already in this sub. Do u not think they can get a scanner to analyze any mentions of gme, the position, amount of shares and ur sell or profit taking limit?? we literally do this exact same thing here where we have bots that count all mentions of a ticker. With big money they can do that on a DIFFERENT level.

so please if anything mention u got in and keep it at that.

Conclusion: Gonna be a hard day and honestly a hard week BUT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO GIVE UP $115 WE NEED $115 to even have a shot at a squeeze and we need it latest by Friday (yes I know I just mentioned a particular strike but only because the funds and MM already know how important $115  is so it's no secret)

May we print tendies and may the power of WSB empower us all to not .

Victory is near because they lost $4 BILLION trying to scare diamond hands which ultimately backfired and just made shares more expensive causing us to reach new all time highs. Soon they will just cut their losses and take a loan to overpay for our shares.

Now do you get why its called Diamond hands? Because you know what you have. Don't panic you will soon be over compensated if you are patient. Thats why DeepFuckingValue doesn't sell because he knows exactly what his shares are worth.

So don't buy any of the newer out the money calls because you're giving them money on the premium. Which they will intentionally crash making sure you never hit that target.

Set the good till date good till cancel. Basically the same system we are fighting allows shorts to borrow our shares to use against us. This is in the fine print when you sign up with your broker.

How do you beat them? Put an active order on the share. As long as there is an active order on your shares then the banks cannot lend the shorts your shares to bet against you. Which in return will create a higher share price for us all.

Some brokers have auto-lend option you can turn off, but some do not. Just to be sure put an active order on the shares. This will raise the price significantly. In return will scare the crap out of the short position forcing them to cover. And bam we win. End of story. Thanks me later.

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

&#x200B;

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because its going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at its highest.

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that youll see today!!!

They  didnt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The  fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm  think the stock is being sold > price goes down > the found that  bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first  place > price drops even more > they keep doing that >  price drops lower every time > but as long as we hold they werent  able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long  as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you dont believe me, look  at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore  dont sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking  higher! Im talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to  the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per  share!!!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND  )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND  )

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

  Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number  of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.   Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted  shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for  the company in question.  A high 'days to cover' ratio can often  signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

  imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days.  Same thing with covering short positions. How  long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their  short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the  average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called  ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The  only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's  getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking  138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because its going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at its highest",0.10190917099999999,0.460326279

6727,1/28/2021,8:54,1/28/2021 8:54,gl20jv3,1611842040,"Why the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: 

Take a look at this link ( https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme

If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on.

Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!!

Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. There's room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

* The market doesn't care what your entry price is. You may have bought in at 1, or bought in at 156 yesterday. The market doesn't care. Short term we are going to see more erratic behavior. If your conviction entering this trade is that eventually GME will moon and the shorts are getting their nuts squeezed off, WHO CARES what the current stock price is. You know the outcome. Stick to your guns so you can see this thing through. Don't sell then jump back in then sell. Buy in heavy and hold, increase your position during the dips to get lower resistance to the stock. Don't sell, a lot of OTM calls are expiring on Friday. The best is yet to come. 
* Most of us in here are not day traders. You're kidding yourself if you think you can ""time the wave"" just right and sell at the high, then buy back in at the low. Even professional traders don't know what they are doing half the time.
* You only get hurt if you jump off a rollercoaster. In this case, imagine how screwed you will be if you jump off a rocket ship as it's accelerating into space.
* Lastly, don't stay up at night imaging what could have been. Who cares that you didn't notice the story until a few days ago, or that you didn't buy more at this time or sell at that time. You're in for the ride now. No one knows where exactly this will go, but 99.9 percent of us know it's going up considering almost everyone in here is doing yolo life savings amount of money into the stock. Don't be disappointed if you hold for 2 days and aren't getting the gains you expected. The story is in the unfolding stage. If the stock drops back down to 75 today, there is always tomorrow and the next day and the next. The stock no doubt is steadily going up regardless of the crazy intraday prices.
* Imagine your wife's boyfriend stopped right before the climax. Imagine the look on your wife's face when she realized her BF pulled out early. Don't let that be you.

Remember Longs. To tie up all available shares. **What needs to be done is we need active orders on all owned shares. So set a sell limit order of say 1000 a share.** And set the good till date good till cancel. Basically **the same system we are fighting allows shorts to borrow our shares to use against up.** This is in the fine print when you sign up with your broker. How do you beat them. **Put an active order on the share. As long as there is an active order on your shares then the banks cannot lend the shorts your shares to bet against you.** Which in return will create a higher share price for us all. Some brokers have auto lend option they can check off but some do not. Just to be sure put an active order on the shares. This will raise the price significantly. In return will scare the crap out of the short position forcing them to cover. And bam we win . End of story. Thanks me later.

AMC current status (01FEB2020):

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire this week or next. So we MUST hold beyond that.

The target this past Friday (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting would be at come today) and that was done. It closed at $13.29 -- AWESOME sauce. This short will expire today.

So when they're forced to cover ($8.63) today they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isn't even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts at 1 - 2 days away (Tuesday) or (Wednesday). What does this mean? The longer WE hold, the higher the price gets and the more money they have to cover. Do I need to explain further?

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a violent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains today are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be MUCH higher.

Short squeezes are historic. TO give you an example when VW did this, it has a 46% short and a $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 08. AMC is at 84% short -- the % is significantly higher and there is a lot more room for it to grow. On the high end we're talking the possibility of hitting $150-$200 A SHARE IF EVERYONE IS SMART AND HOLDING UNTIL THURSDAY.

My recommendation:

1.	BUY
2.	HOLD
3.	BUY MORE
4.	HOLD & ENJOY THE RIDE

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

I This is a re-post. Thanks to Brandon for putting on the AMC board. Its applicable for us as well.

KEY POINTS: (Please read) Like to keep as Top Conversations so ALL reads. (UPDATED)

1.	Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the ""cause"" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.

PATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.

2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying ""lets get this to $30"" or ""let get this to 100"". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.

3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video >>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY

4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc

Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.

	They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.

1.	Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.
2.	Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.
3.	Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.
4.	What is short selling: >> https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp
5.	Short selling does not expire. Options do expire. Familiarize yourself with the difference. Link here: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/092613/difference-between-short-selling-and-put-options.asp
6.	Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.
7.	Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.
8.	Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to tap down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold its only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, Ive lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. Its a classic short move.

If you dont think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up arent calling in favors like this right now youre living in fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. Its only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. Theres no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

Please share and upvote this for god sakes so people dont think everyone else selling out and giving up!!!! Please someone who can post copy and post this I dont want credit I just dont want the little guy to lose!

WSB, HEAR ME NOW:

We are strong enough now to break the rope and take the tree with us. We have gained strength together, we are 2 Million beautiful minds acting on our own individual belief that this stock will go to $5000 and so thats why we set our sell limit to $5000!

Not just normies like me and you, but wealthy individuals like Chamath, Elon and El Presidente Dave Portnoy and may others. Politicians like AOC are tweeting about it. 

This will all be worth it because they now know the power of the people and we won't back down to their scare tactics and rigging.

But because for the past few days we've been fighting this battle, I've never felt so alive. This is the most convicted about a cause, and the most angry I've been about those seeking to destroy that cause, that I've ever been in my whole life. And when I go to my job, I just feel dead inside. Fighting this battle with the rest of GME Gang, standing my ground while my portfolio swings +-25% or more, this feeling is knowing I'm doing something I believe in. Hell I've spent more mental energy and attention on reading everyone's updates and memes, and fending off the bots in New, than I have at my job.

I've been in GME since November last year, before Q3 earnings call. I bought in at $17 and watched the price tank to $12+ and my position down 25%. But I held. I'll admit, it was a small position then and I didn't truly believe. But then Papa Cohen came on board (literally) and I doubled down. Then we started soaring and I tripled down. I've since 5x-ed my initial position.

Initially, I played this for the potential short squeeze. But then I started to believe in the pivot to ecommerce and the inherent value of GameStop. And then as the price started to moon, I was thinking of all the tendies. BUT WITH EACH AND EVERY SCUMMY TACTIC THAT THE INSTITUTIONS HAVE THROWN AT US, I'm getting more and more angry. And this is NO LONGER ABOUT THE TENDIES. This is about sending a message. About taking a stand against the big institutions in their fancy suits thinking they can just continue abusing their power. Who REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY COULD BE WRONG and continue using scummy tactics to spread fear and induce panic selling. The same people who drove the share price of GameStop lower and lower and lower by their excessive shorting. And the greedy fucks weren't content on stopping until they'd bankrupted the whole company.

It's no longer about the tendies my fellow soldiers. This is a fucking WAR, and it's about the principle. Do NOT let them off easy. Papa Cohen, Papa Chamath, and countless others are with us. HOLD YOUR SHARES AND MAKE THEM PAY A FAIR PRICE FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE. You can always make more money, but this is the opportunity of possibly a GENERATION to MAKE A STAND and show that you refuse to allow the system as it is to continue.

Now, I'm not smart. I'm barely even a retard. All my conviction in this cause has come from the excellent DD on this subreddit. And I'm eternally grateful to them. I can't contribute with DD or useful information, other than to HOLD MY DAMN SHARES and hopefully, give some of you the conviction too to join this cause and to HOLD YOUR GROUND.

So I decided I was going to try and sell it for a profit. So as a little 8 year old worm bag, I decided I would try my luck in GameStop. Keep in mind Wiis were reselling nearly double. I walked into the mecca that is GME clutching my Wii box. I asked the guy before the counter could I trade this in for some store credit so I could buy the PS3. This guy asked me to give me a few minutes so he could run the numbers.

As I waited I wondered how much would I get, would I have enough to buy the PS3 AND some games. Would I have enough to buy a PS3 and an XBOX. He returned. He looked me straight in the eye and told me he could do $150. I was shattered. 

My sweaty little palms clutched the box back out to my moms car. I was devastated. I thought I had been cheated.

Little did I know at that time it would be the best decision I ever made because a cousin of mine gave me close to $400.

As I look back I now realise that was a test,  GME knew what I had to become. That guy behind the counter could see my sweaty palm and knew that someday those would need to be diamond.

This can absolutely destroy them financially, so the institutions are losing their f-ing minds over it.

As it stands, these institutions have 6.31 days (average) to cover those options and cover their losses, which is absolutely bonkers and can cause a domino effect of higher share prices.

**Thought experiment**: Imagine having to buy ALL 70 million shares that GME has, meaning every single person that owns stock has to sell you 100% of their shares. The price would skyrocket, and you'd be doomed, right? Okay, now imagine having to buy 2.5 times all of the shares (175 million) and cover in the next week (average cover time). That's what's happening. This is why traders / sharks are frothing at the mouth and telling you to hold the shares and making rocketship emojis. We could all sell at $300 or $3000. It's up to us collectively.

Nobody can say for sure what will happen because there's also market manipulation and fear to deal with, but the math is unbelievably favorable, and it's why the financial institutions are screaming at the top of their lungs. Traders aren't joking when they say the stock can skyrocket.

2) Even if shorts are covering, they aren't doing so a lot. Any short covering would result in huge price movements upward, but the major price movements so far were YESTERDAY (after which we know short % was still \~100% of float), and AFTER HOURS last night (volume was like 5m total).

Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to tap down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold its only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, Ive lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. Its a classic short move.

If you dont think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up arent calling in favors like this right now youre living in fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. Its only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. Theres no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

hy the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: Take a look at this link ( [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC) )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme) If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on. Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!! Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. Also, AMC just paid back $600m of their debt they raised! In an even better position than before because of US. room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.

Disclaimer: I am that monkey. Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:

We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

1Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

2Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

3Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

4Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

5At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

6Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

7The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.

I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares. It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home. DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o)

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",0.01850515,0.479588532

first there is the market makers, who sell call options. every single call option on GME expired in the money last week, which meant market makers had to buy a huge amount of shares to cover the calls they sold. they issued new options today and when gamestop crossed 115 every new option was already in the money because 115 was the highest strike based on 2x last closing. but that's just a small part of the squeeze.

the big squeeze is the hedge funds that are short game stop. right now they're literally being held hostage by gamestop shareholders. some of them have probably already been effectively blown up. melvin capital has a big short position and only has $7 billion assets under management.

there's not going to be anything like a ""GME bagholder"" right now current holders have the hedge funds, their parent companies, and then eventually the investment banks which act as prime brokers for those companies under hostage. they decide the price they have to pay to get out from the squeeze.

theoretically gamestop could reach a $1 trillion market cap end of week if shareholders refuse to sell. small funds which had a short position like melvin are probably already effectively blown up if they didn't close out their short position, their liability will pass on to their parent company. if the parent company blows up now their bank has a problem. if GME holders refuse to sell, the bank could theoretically get liquidated as well. i don't even know what happens after that. it's an unprecedented event.

I didn't sell today. I  saw my truck being paid off and a good chunk of my house. I saw a year of living expenses and getting ahead on my student loans.

I didn't sell today. I've paper handed this stock two times at $13 and $41 to pay bills with little profit. Never did I think that I would be fortunate enough to actually get ahead in life by making a good financial decision against the whales.

Today, I saw the gates of Valhalla. Today, for the first time I felt like I was the one beating the system. A system that has fucked me and my family more times than I could count. Fuck the shorts. GME to Mars

2.	DONT FUCKING SELL!!!!!! the worst thing you can do right now is sell and give these shorts leverage. Take a walk, jerk off, cook your wifes boyfriend breakfast, get your mind off of the market so you dont do anything stupid. Easier said then done for sure but you bought the ticket on the Tard Cart
3.	BUY IN FUCKING CHUNKS!!!!! one of the most mentally deficient things you can do is jizz your pants early like Forrest Gump and throw all of your wad down on what you think is the best price possible. You will get your fucking face ripped off and then will have no money left to get in at lower price points. Nobody times it right, thats why were retarded. 
4.	BE RETARDED, BUT DONT BE FUCKING STUPID!!!!!! This is exhilarating and all and could be very profitable, but dont bite off what you cant chew. The reason the shorts R Fuk Is because they did the exact same thing. But unlike your peasant ass, they have financial institutions they can borrow from when they fuxk up that will bail them out. You are sleeping on a dog bed outside your master bedroom. Do NOT risk rent payments, childrens education, grandmas surgery money on this stupid gamble.

1. Bot brigade negative sentiment on social media, reddit, etc. (this has yet to be common and could be more prevalent soon - though I have seen some new made accounts posting negative sentiment on GME)

2. Buying up the shares we don't have, driving up the price...
a) Hoping to create more liquidity for them by reducing our shares (more defectors as price goes up). 
b) So they can accumulate shares and manufacture large sell offs on volume to create what we saw earlier today

GME was at 37.50 when I bought in. Everyone laughed outside of WSB. No way it can even breach 50 before it falls down to 20 they said. I had a limit sell ready at 50$ for my 7 shares. I was so nervous as I watched it fall to 36. Then jump to 40. Then back down to 37. Then back up to 48. My heartrate jumped up and down with it. I cancelled my limit sell order. I learned within those 15 minutes that this is WSB. This is where dreams are fulfilled. And if you want to win, you must have DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS.

&#x200B;

That was on January 20th (5 days ago). Then on Friday I was finally able to tear myself from my slave wage work and looked at the ticker again. And oh how my heart went up and down. I saw the stock rise to 75. I was close to putting in another limit order for 60 and be done with it. But then I recalled. DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS.

&#x200B;

And again over the weekend I hear it's all over. It's about time for it to crash and leave the muppet users on WSB penniless while the mods who are running this scam make off with their haul. I watched proudly at the propaganda as my hands didn't move. I continued on with my day as my heart didn't even flutter. And this morning we hit 150 and we're still steady at 80 WHICH IS ALREADY MORE THAN LAST WEEK'S RECORD FUCKING HIGH.

&#x200B;

So they said it won't make it back to 50, sell. They said it won't make it back to 60, sell. They said it won't make it back to 70, sell. We broke 50. We broke 60. We broke 70. Today your hearts and those short selling un-American sons of bitches banking on an American company failing are screaming ""It won't make it back to 100, sell"".

Today may scare a lot of you. We all saw GME shoot to 150 and back down to 75. This kind of range has never been seen before in a billion+$ company. 

2 questions - why and how. 

The how is easier to understand so lets start there. Because of the short seller contracts that are currently in process cover a LARGE amount of shares from what would be the float. This means that there is less available shares for trading making the price of the stock extremely volatile. Usually when this happens to a stock a short squeeze will ensue OR the stock will just be driven to bankruptcy... which is what the fuck heads at shitron and Melvin are trying to do. 
With GME - we are seeing a literal historic level of support for GME. This causes the price to go up and the short sellers to have to pay out the difference of how much its going up directly to the people who are taking them up on their put contracts. The most known user for taking up these contracts is u/deepfuckingvalue. With the profits from these calls, our compatriots are buying more shares and contracts. This has the possibility to literally go on forever, or until the short sellers are broke and give up. In the past when this happened, the short sellers stopped because they dont want to get squeezed out of all their money. In the case of GME, the short sellers do not think that WSB has the ability to continue what we started and they are posting more and more short contracts. This means the squeeze is still on. 

Ive touched a bit on the why... but just to be clear we are at fucking war. When you watch this stock you can literally picture the LOTR meme of a battle between already rich jackasses who want GME staff out of jobs and the Reddit buyers keeping the price above yesterdays... every day. 

Every day we see green, we are making our call contracts print us money directly from Melvin and shitron and our leaders making these calls ARE buying shares I promise you. 

To participate: buy shares. Hold them until GME hits 1000 or even after that. 

A squeeze of this magnitude can literally bankrupt Andrew Left. But we need to stay strong. 

The short ratio compared to share float is still above 200%. This is fucking nuts, and if we stop our unified force now, they will make their money back and move on with life. 


NOW, yes literally NOW. Today. Tomorrow. NOW. Is the time where we can hit them where it hurts. We need more buys after hours today, pre market tomorrow and every single fucking dip that comes up tomorrow. 

We have the power right now and we will not loose it. Participate and be rich, or watch us patiently. 

Best of luck my fellow retard.",0.041434549,0.41782789

My  fellow fellows, I have an anxiety disorder and know first hand how  freaking out about stuff irrationally can fuck you up, so please read on  for a physiological look at how to protect your hard-earned tendies in  the coming skirmishes.

After the  last few days in GME (I bought shares last week and am diamond holding),  I feel like trading is a contact sport - I'm wired and tired at the  same time and feel kinda sick and exhilarated.

Some  of what is causing this is our monkey brains squirting adrenaline into  our bodies every time the price moves. Our heart rates spike and we  sweat. Our fight or flight response is activated. THIS IS GREAT IS  ANDREW LEFT JUST KICKED IN YOUR DOOR AND TRIES TO MAKE YOU SELL YOUR GME  SHARES, BUT NOT SO GOOD WHEN ALL YOU ARE DOING IS WATCHING NUMBERS ON A  SCREEN.

Long periods of  adrenaline without an actual physical threat play havoc with you body  and brain. If you do this long enough (and we might be on the battle  field with these fucking boomers for weeks or more) you risk not  thinking clearly and/or becoming too anxious and can become depressed.

Know  that your physical well-being will help you deal with this situation  and keep you mind clear and able to deal with stress. Below are some  ways to manage your stress for the oncoming shenanigans;

* Watch  your caffeine intake - caffeine increases adrenaline production. If you  are already in a wired state, even your regular caffeine intake can  make you jittery and fuck with your ability to focus and think.
* Keep  hydrated - adrenaline and stress hormones zap your kidneys, so drink  plenty of fluids (not your own piss you fucking retards) to help your  body process everything.
* Keep  your vices in check, be it drinking, smoking blah blah blah - your body  has enough to worry about right now so try keep shit in moderation
* Do  something physical - even a walk around the block or a lap around your  workplace or home will help calm you. Same goes for getting some fresh  air and sunlight. Go sit near some greenery (A japanese study has shown  that stress levels lower when we hang out a round trees and shit for a  while) Play with a pet.
* Care  for each other when posting  - This whole GME thing is changing  people's lives. Emotions are charged. Lets support each other and keep  things positive in posts. People are allowed to disagree - a dissenting  opinion is a gift that makes you see things from a different POV.
* **Be  careful who you listen to - this one is the flipside of the point  above. Not every opinion on here or out in the news is coming from a  reliable source. Some are innocently wrong and some are purposefully  trying to spread fear or manipulate this sub like the institutions  manipulate the market. Do your own DD. The mods do a great job (from  what I can see) of removing bullshitters and shill posters, but be  aware.**

A little basic math.


There are 69.75M shares of $GME outstanding.


Short interest is more than 130%. 


Short-sellers are paying an annual rate of 32.7% for the privilege of having done so. 


Let's keep it simple and say that bears have shorted 100M shares of $GME.


Let's estimate the average short sale was at $40. 


Based on this math, that interest is owed on $4 BILLION. 


On an annual basis, the shorts will be paying $1.308 BILLION annually on these short sales.


The market is open M-F with a few holidays here and there - about 250 days per year. 


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $5 million per market day.


The market is open 7.5 hours per day.  


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $700,000 per hour.


There are 60 minutes in an hour.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $12,000 per minute.


There are 60 seconds in a minute.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $194 per second. 


---


Sit back and think about.  Count to ten.  That's $1,940 that you just cost those short-sellers.  And it cost you literally nothing. 


Go take a cigarette break.  Ten minutes.  That's another $120,000 you cost those fuckers.


Now hide your phone.  Get so drunk that you pass out and don't come to until the market's closed.  Two more hours.  $1.4 million down the drain for those faithless pukes.

Here is some proof of this point  it was shown on Friday. Gamma Squeeze Friday.
Volume of GME on Friday was 197M. Record breaking. Lets go back again to the available
float 47M. That means if EVERY share of GME was traded that day that share would have been
traded 5 times. Theres just no possible way every available share was traded 5 times. I know
DFV didnt sell and rebuy 5 times. I know my paltry 1700 shares didnt get sold and bought 5
times. So where did the volume come from? It was bothering me all weekend.

>The volume was because deeply OTM calls were now in the money. With fewer and fewer
shares actually trading during the day, any rise in GME price had a compounding effect on
gamma and shorts. The people who sold those calls had to go back and buy more shares to
cover their calls. But there werent enough shares- so they had to buy those shares, pay to
close a position, buy the shares again, close a position, again and again. (The dips in volume on
the chart were the halts during trading)

Today was less a short squeeze and more a continuation of the Gamma Squeeze we experienced on Friday. Lots of other DD regarding that, but a lot of it has to do with the clearinghouse and share settlements that all happened today.

Look for next week to potentially repeat this as Thursday and Friday, investors will probably pile into $115c 0DTE options and will cause a similar gamma squeeze.

This is unrelated to the impending short squeeze, but I am curious what level of a gamma squeeze would trigger the margin calls that ultimately trigger the short squeeze.

No financial advice here. Just sharing thoughts.

If you held through today, it was glorious and painful. I saw money I never thought Id see and then I lost it all the same.

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

But because for the past few days we've been fighting this battle, I've never felt so alive. This is the most convicted about a cause, and the most angry I've been about those seeking to destroy that cause, that I've ever been in my whole life. And when I go to my job, I just feel dead inside. Fighting this battle with the rest of GME Gang, standing my ground while my portfolio swings +-25% or more, this feeling is knowing I'm doing something I believe in. Hell I've spent more mental energy and attention on reading everyone's updates and memes, and fending off the bots in New, than I have at my job.

I've been in GME since November last year, before Q3 earnings call. I bought in at $17 and watched the price tank to $12+ and my position down 25%. But I held. I'll admit, it was a small position then and I didn't truly believe. But then Papa Cohen came on board (literally) and I doubled down. Then we started soaring and I tripled down. I've since 5x-ed my initial position.

Initially, I played this for the potential short squeeze. But then I started to believe in the pivot to ecommerce and the inherent value of GameStop. And then as the price started to moon, I was thinking of all the tendies. BUT WITH EACH AND EVERY SCUMMY TACTIC THAT THE INSTITUTIONS HAVE THROWN AT US, I'm getting more and more angry. And this is NO LONGER ABOUT THE TENDIES. This is about sending a message. About taking a stand against the big institutions in their fancy suits thinking they can just continue abusing their power. Who REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY COULD BE WRONG and continue using scummy tactics to spread fear and induce panic selling. The same people who drove the share price of GameStop lower and lower and lower by their excessive shorting. And the greedy f\*ks weren't content on stopping until they'd bankrupted the whole company.

It's no longer about the tendies my fellow soldiers. This is a f\*king WAR, and it's about the principle. Do NOT let them off easy. Papa Cohen, Papa Chamath, and countless others are with us. HOLD YOUR SHARES AND MAKE THEM PAY A FAIR PRICE FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE. You can always make more money, but this is the opportunity of possibly a GENERATION to MAKE A STAND and show that you refuse to allow the system as it is to continue.

Now, I'm not smart. I'm barely even an r-word. All my conviction in this cause has come from the excellent DD on this subreddit. And I'm eternally grateful to them. I can't contribute with DD or useful information, other than to HOLD MY DAMN SHARES and hopefully, give some of you the conviction too to join this cause and to HOLD YOUR GROUND.

I wish to make a formal complaint about the services you failed to provide on a very important day for trading, thousands of customers have been affected by your lack of contingency plan as I am aware your intermediary (IB) has halted sell and buy orders.

Under section SYSC 3.1 Systems and controls of the FCA handbook ( https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/SYSC/3/1.html ) I believe you have terribly failed your responsibility.

Who knows if this manipulation in the stock market was conspired between yourself and other brokers but im sure it will soon be investigated by the proper authorities.

In the meantime honest consumers such as myself are left with our money held up in stocks that can plummet and rise by (15%+) every few minutes without a way to exit our positions. Due to the volatility you claim your intermediary was looking out for the owners of these stocks by implementing these restrictions but I dont believe that.

If your response is unsatisfactory I will be escalating this complaint further to the financial ombudsmen.

# Friday, Jan 29 is NOT the sell date for GME.

Recently I have started to see a lot of posts and comments hinting at a Friday sell-off because that is when the squeeze is going to happen. **THIS IS FAKE NEWS!!!!!!!**

The reason why Friday was initially brought up, to begin with, is because every OTM GME call that was written by MMs a couple of weeks ago are now ITM. This means by Friday close, any MM that did not properly hedge their GME position will be a victim to a Gamma squeeze in which millions of GME shares will have to be bought in order to fill out the call orders as they get exercised. This will **potentially** trigger the short squeeze as millions of shares are bought in quick succession forcing the price upwards in an even more parabolic manner.

If the short squeeze does not happen on Friday, then next week will just be a repeat of this week. More retail buying, more CNBC fear-mongering, and more GME calls becoming ITM.

# Fundamentally, there is NO difference between this Friday and any other Friday

Also, on another note, when the short squeeze does happen, keep these facts in mind:

# Short Squeezes are NOT quick events. Shorters can take days or even WEEKS to cover their positions.

I have also noticed that some people are starting to get the idea that the squeeze will be quick and be done.  **THIS IS FALSE.**

The duration of a short squeeze is measured by the Days To Cover Ratio **(Total Short Float / Average Daily Trading Volume).**

Right now, the DTC is at 6 days on MarketBeat and the short float is at 121% as of this morning [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/)

DTC data at shortsqueeze is more recent. It has DTC at 2.5days. 

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME)

Find short float data here:

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME)

Feel free to send me more links so I can post it here and make adjustments.

**When can you tell a short squeeze is happening?**

Pay very close attention to the short float as per the total number of shares outstanding. When the short float starts to go down drastically, it means the rocket ship just hit 0 Gs and we are now bound for infinity and beyond!

**What is the price target?**

No one knows but unlike the squeeze of Volkswagon, where the institutions reached an agreement with the company board, there is **NO WAY** hedge funds can make an agreement with us retail investors (*because we are not a singular entity and anyone that says otherwise is either ignorant or pushing a false narrative*) so the price is whatever we want it to be. Either way, that $1,000 price target is starting to look **REALLY** cheap right now so in my opinion, you might want to add a zero to that.

12481,1/28/2021,16:47,1/28/2021 16:47,gl34xbk,1611870448,"Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to tap down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold its only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, Ive lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. Its a classic short move.

If you dont think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up arent calling in favors like this right now youre living in fucking fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. Its only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price.

If you wake up and see $100 and your heart falls out your pussy and you get paper hands, game over. If you see $100 and instead remember how fucking jazzed you were when it first hit that and hold, you win baby.

AND STOP THINKING THE SQUEEZE WILL NE FRODAY. THERES NO SET TIME FOR IT. THE WHOLE POINT IS WE HAVE CONTROL FOR HOW FAR IT GOES. 

If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. Theres no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

Here's what's going on with GME, if you're new.

People who shorted the stock expect it to go down. They will need to buy the stock to cover their shorts. If there are enough uncovered shorts that will need shares, their buying of the stock will drive the price up. Other short sellers see the price going up and buy the stock to mitigate their losses, driving the stock price up. Other short sellers see the price going up and the process repeats. That's the short squeeze.

GME has solid fundamentals and substantial revenue from recent earnings report, and now I think there's more short interest (short interest is the amount of shares needed to cover all uncovered shorts) than outstanding stock that can be bought. So if 100% of outstanding stock is held by retail investors that refuse to sell, the short demand for the stock drives the price up more. Therefore, at some point, shorts will be trying to buy shares that just aren't there, bringing the stock up a monumental amount. That's what's happening, that's the short squeeze, that's why people are saying ""fuck citron"" because citron shorted the shares, that's why people are saying ""don't fucking sell"" because short sellers covering their shorts will lessen the amount the price can go up.",0.034800385,0.423496873

A little basic math.


There are 69.75M shares of $GME outstanding.


Short interest is more than 130%. 


Short-sellers are paying an annual rate of 32.7% for the privilege of having done so. 


Let's keep it simple and say that bears have shorted 100M shares of $GME.


Let's estimate the average short sale was at $40. 


Based on this math, that interest is owed on $4 BILLION. 


On an annual basis, the shorts will be paying $1.308 BILLION annually on these short sales.


The market is open M-F with a few holidays here and there - about 250 days per year. 


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $5 million per market day.


The market is open 7.5 hours per day.  


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $700,000 per hour.


There are 60 minutes in an hour.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $12,000 per minute.


There are 60 seconds in a minute.


That means your DIAMOND HANDS are costing the shorts $194 per second. 


---


Sit back and think about.  Count to ten.  That's $1,940 that you just cost those short-sellers.  And it cost you literally nothing. 


Go take a cigarette break.  Ten minutes.  That's another $120,000 you cost those fuckers.


Now hide your phone.  Get so drunk that you pass out and don't come to until the market's closed.  Two more hours.  $1.4 million down the drain for those faithless pukes.

Wrong. $1,000 is very possible. So yes, it's still a good time to buy. Here's why:


- Friday's insane price movement was due mostly to gamma squeeze, not shorts covering at all. The circuit breakers weren't a bad thing, but ultimately probably did screw us over since this thing was headed to $100/share.


- Market Makers who sold options that expired in the money on 1/22 (all of them, lol) need to buy those shares by Tuesday. Per other posts, that's about 15 million shares.


- Estimates are that there will be around 20 million shares available to trade after those 15 million shares are bought. Volume on Friday was around 200 million.


- Shares are either completely unavailable to short or almost impossible to. I've seen both suggested. And shorting is currently costing a fortune, as brokers are raising interest rates on anyone shorting it.



- People are still eager to DUMP money into GME shares and calls. Read through anything on here, talk to anyone, etc. Everyone wants to be a part of it now that it's mainstream. Way more interest now than there was before, and most of it coming from outside of WSB.



- Short interest is HIGHER now than before. All estimates I've seen put it well over 100%. Somewhere around 70 million shares short. Again, no short shares were covered on Friday.


- GameStop, Cohen, et al have said nothing. As far as we know publicly, everything we know about this company remains unchanged from about a week ago. As soon as they release their plan, make a statement, or tweet a rocket emoji, this thing is going to go nuclear without any short squeeze.



- Share dilution could be a very small risk and could cause a minor panic, but ultimately it's great for GameStop. They'll be able to pay off debt and be better-positioned to move forward with Cohen's vision. Looks like they have just under $500 million in debt currently, about half of which is long-term debt. They're paying between 6-10%, which could likely be refinanced, paid off, etc. In short, selling $100 million in shares gives them a lot of options and makes them strong like bull.


- There is no indication any short squeeze has happened. And even a slow short squeeze where people paper hand left and right isn't enough to keep the stock from skyrocketing since short sellers are so underwater.


- Cohen and the other board members are already rich. They didn't do this to get rich and walking away right after obtaining board seats is not going to happen.



- GameStop already had their negative pandemic press and is up like a thousand percent since then. Remember that? News/lawsuits won't stop this thing.


TL;DR: This thing hasn't even started going up yet. Buy shares of GME. Don't buy options if you've never done that before because they can be tricky and shares alone will be extremely profitable. Don't worry about people posting gains over $1 million. Most of them have been holding this stock for months. If you can invest $1,500 and turn it into a car, it was worth it.

PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday",0.12089781699999999,0.44286706299999995

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves.

They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

Are you here to flex your papyrus metacarpi with a measely +911% return, only for Melvin to ride out of this to short another day?

Are you here to bow down to Citadel and prove to them that they still have total control over our market?

 GME is in a infinite short/gamma squeeze with no way out until you get enough sellers at a certain price. It's a loop that only occurs once in a lifetime, and after this new guidelines will be written. So follow along. there is a float of 47 million shares. Cohen bought 13% and had the option of 20% which the float hasn't been adjusted. so lets say he owns 14 million shares because shares outstanding 70 million. Ok so the float is 34 million and this is the number to base everything off. The total shares short when last listed were 70 million. Then you have 2 million CALLS deep IN THE MONEY this is important. The 2 million CALLS represent 200 million shares and if the float is only 34 million then the CALL sellers are net short 166 million followed by the other 70 million shares which gets you at 236 million shares net short. So it's like a spring coil every time the stock goes up the CALL sellers need to delta hedge or buy shares to off set their CALLS, but they can't because really only 34 million available shares. So the stock goes up, CALL buyers buy even more shares, shorts cover some because price rockets. Then the price goes really high the longs decide to sell to lock in some gains causing the stock to go back down, but then when it drops the shorts start covering more causing it to go back up and the CALL Sellers are still way off on the delta hedge. This spring is in a infinite loop causing it to go higher and higher. The only way out because there is not enough shares to buy, is for the price to rise to such a level that people sell in mass. This won't stop until 3 things happen, and all three will cause the price so much higher than right now. 1st they can't short this and they need to cover in mass. 2nd they need to buy back these CALLS in mass and I mean maybe 200K total CALLS outstanding. 3rd they need to drop the short float to like 10-12 million or 30% or below. Lastly they need so many sellers and I mean like millions of people selling. The only way this stops is if everything comes to fruition, but the price is going to be SO much higher than now for these to happen.

1) No, the SEC has no legal grounds to prosecute us or stop the trading on this stock.

2) Yes, hold your shares even when you see the stock dip like mad tomorrow - it's pretty much guaranteed to happen since the shorts will be dead if they allow the stock to remain at this price.

3) No, this is not financial advice. Do your own research and take the time to understand why this GME trade might be the best thing the world has seen since sliced bread.

As for me? All in on GME at 1281 shares. The fact that market makers are fighting so desperately to drop the share price should tell you that they're feeling the pressure.

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it",0.12849206300000002,0.43152194200000005

I hate to have to repost this however we need to spread AWARENESS on the issue of Market Manipulation and the current events. No, I AM NOT A BOT. I am a real person that lives in a cold dark room with my dog and I haven't showered in 5 weeks. I'm kidding! but I am Canadian. I am also in college so i don't have the fucking time to respond differently to every post. IM SORRY. But you all need to know this information.

GME IS NOT OVER! They are turning the average AUTIST into smooth brains!! This is true that bots have taken over WSB. This is true that bots with many awards bought by the hedge funds have taken over. WE MUST STAND TOGETHER. THIS VIDEO WILL EXPLAIN ALL YOUR DOUBTS!! 

In the following weeks, GME has plummeted. I will not deny that this week has been rough for everyone, including myself. The price had the appearance of everyone selling however my belief is that **phantom shares** are being brought into the market which in turn are being sold for less hence driving the price lower. To all the paper hand bitches; they also contributed a bit to the price being driven down. Now, I have linked a video that goes into thorough detail on why this is not over. It's not just showing graphs and discussing the trends, it goes over ALL THE EVENTS that have happened and the EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE '**SQUOOZE** of the **SQUEEZE'**. The HEDGE FUNDS are trying to scare us into selling. THESE BOTS are trying to make us sell. THESE ACCOUNTS(BOTS) can be BOUGHT and to manipulate US! FOR SOME, it is WORKING! Some of these accounts have so many awards blah blah blah, but none of them are OG WSB members!

Also, search up on youtube: **GROW TO ATTAIN**, the latest video on phantom shares will clear up everything for you and what to expect. So far, this is all in our favor if we keep holding or buying shares!

ALSO, look AT THAT LINK I POSTED, IT WILL CLEAR UP MANY THINGS FOR YOU! ALL POSITIVES FOR HOLD GANG, 400 GANG, 300 GANG, 200, 100, 5 GANG.

Also to all the new WSB members, welcome! Some of these posts are TOXIC, though WSB's goal HAS NOT CHANGED; AUTISTS/APES are taking that rocket ship and shoving it into Uranus. This means, if you want in the action, you must decide to get your ticket. Just make sure you don't put your money for College/University (I wonder what happened to that guy/girl) or life savings, this is a very volatile stock. Just know that you either are a paper handed bitch, or a diamond hand BAMF.  Once this rocket leaves the lithosphere, we ain't coming back to pick up the stragglers. So GET IN WHILE YOU STILL CAN!

JUST KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE STILL HOLDING! APES STAND TOGETHER AND WE SHALL PREVAIL! Also, FEB 9th is coming up, IMPORTANT DAY! Mark it on your calendars! Check out this video for the reason why it's important, plus an explanation on why we have NOT lost the war! THE BATTLE THIS WEEK, WE LOST, HOWEVER THEY HAVEN'T WON THE WAR!

Also, rest up, hydrate, and be prepared for the weeks to come. We shall have our movie, with a happy ending!

I'm not a financial advisor, I am not telling you what to do with your money. I'm just an APE who likes this stock!! 

I would also post the to the WSB Forum, however, my karma level is too low/they won't allow me to post for some reason, I would post it there too if I could. I cant even make a post on this forum either!

As some of you might know, there is a sub which is basically a german WSB ( r/Mauerstrassenwetten ). 

In this sub, the GME hype is just as real as it is here. 
Everyday at 7:30 CET, we buy whatever we can buy. We Hold, we hold as if our lives were to depend on it, and we try to keep the stock as high as possible, until the reinforcement which has the *actual* buying power, comes in at 15:30 CET, or rather 9:30 EST. 

You are the reinforcement. 

You are the buying power. 

You are the allies, this time with the germans on your side, and a mission to accomplish. 

We count on you to buy and hold, we believe in you to buy and hold, and we depend on you to buy and hold. 

*Together*! We can crush the market manipulating, shorting cunts at melvin, shitron and all the other shitshows. 

This is not just a thing between americans. I have seen people from sweden, the netherlands, spain poland and countless other european nations on this sub, salivating to the thought of crushing GMEs enemys. 

*I REPEAT SOLDIERS: THIS IS A INTERCONTINENTAL MISSION. EUROPE STANDS STRONG ON YOUR SIDE AND TOGETHER, WE CAN USE OUR  TO CRUSH THE MARKET MANIPULATING CUNTS.

Melvin, Shitron, and company  will keep this going because it's going to be like 100x more expensive to just give in and they think we will run out of steam or get bored. 

Little do they know is I'm all in.  I eat crayons, stick my finger in electrical sockets, and lick windows.  This is our time.  We buy every dip they throw at us with our 2.3583 shares in our dinky Robinhood accounts.  

They will come hard at us today.  We are fucking with their ability to manipulate the market but we have a vision that they don't.  We know GME with some major changes has the ability to pivot and make money.  This isn't about the squeeze but saving our childhood gaming stores.  We can do this.  It's about creating higher lows each dip.  


  I am a mouth breather who can't stop , won't stop , GameStop     ***Don't listen to me.  I eat crayons and this is not financial advice

Edit 3: Dont you sell.....I know you.....you are thinking about it.  You are up 100%.  This never happens to you.  This is life changing money......no you sit on your dumb hands.  Ask your wife's boyfriend to hold you down like he does to her.  You fucking sit and wait.....it's not over yet

Edit 4:. 48.50 is our new support.  Get in fellow crayon eaters lol

Edit 5:. You smooth brained  idiots are doing it.  Got options sell and buy more shares.  Don't you fucking sell.  52 our new support.  Dont let it dip

Edit 6: Someone actually asked me about it being over bought on the RSI.  Dude.  It's to the moon. This thing should be a 90s on the 1 hour RSI.  



Edit 7:. Updates.  So we hit big sell wall around 75.  They are fucking scared and they pushed it down and shut down the breakers.  Good.  Now don't get scared.  Don't paper hands.  Now we buy the dip and they will say fuckkmmmeeee.  

Edit 8: 60 is the new support. Hold this line and buy.  Like trench warfare we are advancing and they know they are fucked.  Keep the faith and diamond hands.  Buy more commons.  Sell your options.  You made enough.  We need your help prying away shares from them with people that will hold forever.

The rocket up in GME and other commonly shorted stocks was a margin call on a fund that was short. By being margin called on gme, they had to buy back the shares sending the price skyrocketing, triggering the halt because of the 10% up in 5 mins rule. 

Buying back their gme shares then triggers their other short positions in a chain reaction of short covering. So why did it go down? They closed their short position, that means those shares are shortable again, and you can bet you ass there was a broker calling a short fund during the stop asking if they wanted the position. 

Nothing has changed, that was the first of many short fund margin calls as gme continues to experience buy pressure based on the renewed business model under daddy Cohen.

You turned 62 this year. You have five beautiful children, six cars, a dozen properties and three homes. You flew to your ranch in New Zealand ([where you're a citizen](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/doomsday-prep-for-the-super-rich)) in late February and you've been been waking up at 3 am to start your work day on EST for the last eleven months.

It has been fine, and at least you haven't had that COVID nonsense to deal with, but the early mornings are starting to wear on you. You've been talking about retiring for years now and it's finally time. You can only manage nine figure portfolios for so many years. The business takes its toll. You talk to your wife and you both agree: you'll submit your retirement notice right after you collect your Q1 bonus. Since it's going to be your last bonus, you agree, it better be a good one.

Your bonus structure is straightforward: the more you percentage points you beat the S&P 500 by, the bigger your bonus. You don't beat, you don't get a bonus. You blow up your portfolio, you're fired, of course.

It's Monday February 1st, and one of your flunkies asks you if you saw that $GME hit $1000 last Friday. ""$GME?"" you say, ""the nearly bankrupt video game retailer?"". They explain to you that yes, a bunch of retail investors bought the meme. It clicks: this is how you're going to secure your last sweet sweet bonus. And hey, even if you're wrong, what are they going to do? Fire you? So you make the call: ""Short $GME. All. In.""

Do you know how many fucking Vinces there are?

Meanwhile, in basements around the world, WSBers and non-WSBers alike chant ""WE LIKE THIS STOCK"". $GME rockets up to $2000 by mid day and $4,000 by close. Twitter blows up, it's all anyone can talk about. The Tuesday headlines all read: ""$GME to $10,000?"". Soon everyone and their dog is in to take down the Vinces.

President Biden addresses the nation on Thursday February 4th: ""Folks, you have to stop buying $GME. The market can only bear so much. Nearly every institutional investor in the nation is begging you, please don't hold. They'll lose it all."" At that moment, America ceases to be a divided nation.

 We're not manipulating the stock; we're buying a stock we believe in. We've read he DD and heard our fellow autist's explanations as to why THEY like the stock. Anything outside of that could have potential legal implications.

 The MMs, that short sold this company's shares into oblivion, did not take into account their personal risk tolerance (sound familiar? They've never cared about your losses, so let this be a lesson for them); the inevitable short squeeze is their mess to unwind. It has nothing to do with us and our decision to support our favorite game-sales company and its new board member Mr. Ryan Cohen.

 WHEN the time comes that your shares are on the line, either from your paper handed fears, or from some big settlement case (in which the insolvent short sellers have to get the shareholders - us - to sign of on their plea bargain), remember that you're not selling shares for what the market says they are worth AT THAT MOMENT.

They will be asking you to hand over a GROWING ASSET with future potential to be much more valuable than what it is at the time of considering your sale.

Keep this in mind as you hold your precious shares. There aren't enough to go around, and you're lucky to be holding even one.

Don't let them bully, scare, or manipulate you into selling for a PENNY less than what you COULD get at the highest point betwee now and 2030.

MELVIN HAS LIKELY NOT COVERED, THEY LIKELY HAVE A PUT AT $350, THIS IS THE NEW BARRIER, SMASH THROUGH IT

Melvin haven't closed out. This is a manipulation tactic to drive down prices, either to cover their losses, or they've made a put at $350. This is the dirtiest trick yet, so they must be desperate. If we smash through $350, they are probably done permanently.

There are also other shorts open, for taking which we don't focus on. They still need to be squashed.

All this does is present a last chance to get on the rocket if you haven't done so already.

I won't answer any fucking questions from newbs.

1. Do you want to know why there seems to be a mass movement to push the narrative that the shorts have closed?

2. At 4PM today the NYSE reports the 1/15 short interest in stocks.

3. That report is going to show GME was shorted to fucking epically epic proportions.

4. The shorters telling the world they are out are still in.  They are trying to drive down the price before the report comes out.

5. Before I hear ""BBBBut that report is from 1/15, it's not current"" - It doesn't fucking matter.  Here's why- the report will show short interest from 1/15.  It's simple charting and math to see how much short interest was removed from 1/15 to today.  And what that math will show is that GME is still massively shorted at a level of 2x-4x the float.

An ELI5 for newbies/those who dont understand whats going on.

GME is in a infinite short/gamma squeeze with no way out until you get enough sellers at a certain price. It's a loop that only occurs once in a lifetime, and after this new guidelines will be written. So follow along. there is a float of 47 million shares. Cohen bought 13% and had the option of 20% which the float hasn't been adjusted. so lets say he owns 14 million shares because shares outstanding 70 million. Ok so the float is 34 million and this is the number to base everything off. The total shares short when last listed were 70 million. Then you have 2 million CALLS deep IN THE MONEY this is important. The 2 million CALLS represent 200 million shares and if the float is only 34 million then the CALL sellers are net short 166 million followed by the other 70 million shares which gets you at 236 million shares net short. So it's like a spring coil every time the stock goes up the CALL sellers need to delta hedge or buy shares to off set their CALLS, but they can't because really only 34 million available shares. So the stock goes up, CALL buyers buy even more shares, shorts cover some because price rockets. Then the price goes really high the longs decide to sell to lock in some gains causing the stock to go back down, but then when it drops the shorts start covering more causing it to go back up and the CALL Sellers are still way off on the delta hedge. This spring is in a infinite loop causing it to go higher and higher. The only way out because there is not enough shares to buy, is for the price to rise to such a level that people sell in mass. This won't stop until 3 things happen, and all three will cause the price so much higher than right now. 1st they can't short this and they need to cover in mass. 2nd they need to buy back these CALLS in mass and I mean maybe 200K total CALLS outstanding. 3rd they need to drop the short float to like 10-12 million or 30% or below. Lastly they need so many sellers and I mean like millions of people selling. The only way this stops is if everything comes to fruition, but the price is going to be SO much higher than now for these to happen. Gamestop could spit in everyone face when they walk in the door and it's won't matter because this stock is stuck in this insane loop

Melvin and Citadel have access to Robinhood information, and perhaps more on positions, limit sells and most importantly, stop losses. This is because Citadel is the broker to Robinhood. 

Why should you remove them? Because they can manipulate they market down to where the average holder has a stop loss to limit their own losses, as evidenced 10 minutes before close today (didn't work though lol)

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.

PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because its going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when shorts have to close their positions and as a result of that they themselves take the price higher.

More by u/Common-Buy-2379 in comment section:

AMC is also 49.85% owned by a Chinese holding company. This company controls over 75% of voting shares indirectly, through controlling interest in subsidiaries that also own shares.

They will NOT be bailing out the hedge funds, which would dilute their ownership in the company. They will not be floating their shares for sale during the squeeze.

In all likelihood, the upcoming stock issuance will be sold to larger firms with little interest in assisting the hedges, and will probably remain within Chinese control.

Not financial advice, I just read the 10-k, 8-k, and 10-q, because I like this stock. Also tendies. I love tendies.

To illustrate, If the Chinese owned shares aren't available to fill the shorts, then there's only 13M shares to fill the 44M shorts.

It's WAY shorter than people think.

Edit: Earlier I had shorts expire in this post which seemingly drew some people crazy ignoring other important aspects. I meant to say when shorts will have to cover their positions. Edited in post.

KEY POINTS: (Please read) Like to keep as Top Conversations so ALL reads. (UPDATED)

1. Patience !! Hedge Fund's will now be banking, literally, on the notion we, or most of us, will be impatient and take profits right away. If you do - this whole plan falls apart. Do not be tempted by small profits. You need to hold and not sell. We also have to keep buying. For those here mostly for the ""cause"" - spread your buying out because we need continued buying from retailers. It took GME 12 days to hit $400+.

PATIENCE IS KEY. You need to have more patience than the hedge funds.

2. Do not set sell limits at $30, $50, or $100. If you're going to make a sell limit, put it at $1,000 or higher. Please, everyone, stop saying ""lets get this to $30"" or ""let get this to 100"". This has so much more potential than those low numbers. Patience, and hold.

3. How does a short squeeze work: Watch this video >>> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJPNdJ06AqY)

4. What are the tactics Hedge Fund's play to scare you into selling? This video will show you: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc)

Familiarize yourself with their games and what they do so you can spot it and not fall into their traps.

 They will manipulate the market to drop the price. DO NOT SELL if you see it drop drastically, only buy. DO NOT SELL at prices for small profits and gains.

1. Stop asking what the price will go to or expecting a specific price. Nobody can predict this and nobody will be able to tell you, period. However - if everyone has patience, buys, and holds - it will go up, and up, and up. The price, technically speaking, is infinite.
2. Do not exit your Robinhood today to move it to another account. Just open another broker account and buy through there: Fidelity, Wealthsimple, Direct Investing (RBC), or any other platform that doesn't restrict buying. If you have a RH account, just keep holding those there for now.
3. Make sure you only invest as much as you are comfortable with losing. You could lose money, or you could make a boat load of money - both are possible.
4. What is short selling: >> [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp)

6. Fundamentals alone, AMC is easily worth $30-$40 long term after the pandemic, that is why you should DEFINITELY not sell for less than this. With a clean balance sheet now due to getting rid of all of their debt, AMC is going to be a valuable company regardless of what happens.
7. Short Interest is calculated by dividing the amount of shares shorted by the float shares. Float shares are the amount of shares available in the market for trading. Float is NOT the same as Oustanding shares (287m). Please understand the difference.
8. Again. I cannot stress this enough - if you are here, you are either wanting to make good money, or you want to stick it to Wall Street, or both. To do this, WE need to hold out longer than they do in order to drive that price up and up. HOLD. Buy, and HOLD. Do not sell for small profits.

Everyone,

TIME is the enemy of Wall Street. Theyre running like a chicken with no head. They have to COVER and pay INTEREST!!

AS LONG AS YOU HOLD AND DONT SELL, those big dips are NOT REALIZED LOSSES! Theyre just psychological losses to make you DOUBT AND SELL!

Brokers restricting PURCHASE of these stocks is creating an UNFAIR ratio of SUPPLY and due to the restriction of stock it creates a LOW DEMAND! Therefore when theres a big supply and low demand is when the stock price goes down. However, there is A LOT OF DEMAND and thats why theyre playing DIRTY and restricted purchase to CREATE A FAKE LOW DEMAND! Thats why there are lawsuits. 

1) HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS

2) DONT LET WALL STREET BULLY YOU

3) AS DAY PASSES WALL STREET CONTINUE TO BLEED since they have to cover and pay interest

4)HOLD AND BUY

5)REMOVE YOUR STOP LOSSES

6) SET LIMIT AS HIGH AS YIU CAN

7) DO NOT LOCK IN GAINS because you want to BUY DIPS. With the restriction, this strategy is not plausible

8) AMC/GME ruled out bankruptcy so your stock wont be $0

9) DOUBLE CHECK any news or analyst or posts as they may try to scare you with fake facts. Do your own DD

10) think positive of the BIG REWARD. You CANT lose more than your total investment but  GAINS ARE LIMITLESS and this is whats SCARING wallstreet. (Example if you invested 10k, all you would lose would be 10k but could be walking away with 100k, 1 million , 10 million depending on the resilience of all of us to BUY AND HOLD)

GME was great but it wasn't publisised as much beforehand as much AMC is, AMC has gone mainstream with people all over the world even celebrities on board not just redditors. Also at GME's peak they were restricted by criminals like robinhood trying to stop them buying stock. Hopefully by now people have found other ways to buy instead of being limited. So we have far more people on board, we won't be limited by what we can buy and 86% of the stock is shorted so all this means we could see huge gains once the squeeze kicks in. Next week could be epic! It only took 3 days for GME to go from 40 to 460 a share so let's see where we end up  ALL WE NEED TO DO IS BUY & HOLD AND WE GO TO THE FUCKING MOON!!!!

""To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because its going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at its highest""",0.10190917099999999,0.460326279

**GME Is More Than About the Squeeze, It's About An Idea**

As we gearing up for another battle, I honestly believe the story of GME is about more than just triggering the short squeeze, its also a story of the underdog coming up on top, of everyday Davids vs the Goliaths of the financial world. 

Here, let me explain. When this community caught on to the GME trade and started making Melvin, GS, BoA, and now Citadel bleed billions because of their reckless naked short selling, we didnt just start milking them for every dollar they have; we did something far deadlier. We showed the world that us retail investors are just as capable, or sometimes, even better at identifying market inefficiencies and profiting off of them than the so called smart money. That, unlike the billions they could lose in the GME short squeeze, is something they can **never** afford to lose. 

Just think about it. What do **ALL** of these fund managers and institutional investors have in common? What is their schtick? That you, the everyday people, should give them **YOUR** money because they are **SMARTER** than you, **BETTER** investors than you, and **KNOW** what they are doing. We just showed the world that **THAT** sales pitch, is pure bullshit. By screwing over the institutional shorts, we just essentially crashed their party, took a **MASSIVE** dump in their punch bowl, laughed about it, **AND** most importantly, showed the world that we, retail investors, despite having the deck stacked up against us multiple times, can still come out on top due to good, high quality DD and sheer determination. 

Right now, institutions think of us as ants crawling around on the ground. They are not wrong in that regard. As individual ants, we are vulnerable to get crushed by pretty much anything, but when we group together in the thousands, hundreds of thousands, and even millions as we are now, we can tear the entire fucking forest down based on the simple OPINION that WE LIKE THE STOCK. 

Regardless of how this play goes, been an honor lads. Lets get the fucking bread.

This is insane, but it is important to all newbies who want to make a quick buck to know why everyone is shouting ""HOLD"" and ""DIAMOND HANDS"" and ""DON'T SELL"" all the time.

The fact of the matter is this: When the short squeeze happens, the people who shorted the shares for GME will be FORCED TO BUY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE PRICE. Once this happens, demand will increase, triggering the next wave of shorters to cover their positions and buy at THE NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE.

                   

Now what I'm going to say next is possibly the most important part of this whole post: WE COLLECTIVELY CONTROL THE PRICES AT WHICH THE SHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARES. That's right, if 100% of people who owned shares in GME right now were to set their limit sells to $1000, then the shorts would be forced to buy at that price to cover their positions. This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

DON'T BE SCARED!! So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win. (If you want to of course this is not financial advice ;))

(They attacked Robinhood, attacked wsb, attacked reddit. BUY THIS DIP)

So there has been a huge effort on the behalf of the shorts to mislead everyone. There idea is to misdirect. They said they got out of their short positions but the float is STILL 138.4% and the stock only got to 365 in AH where it's easy to manipulate price. For reference, AMC is 36.58%, Telsa is 8%.

GME is 138.4% they doubled down and are trying everyway to distract you to other stocks. My guess would be they are the ones pumping up AMC because they know most Robinhood users can do anything unless they sell their GME positions. They NEED your shares to get out of this jam. If you sell, you give them the ammo to do it. People are asking is the squeeze over? The squeeze didn't even start yet by the look of it.

They want you to run over to some other short positions. They figure if all of us take profits today they will accumulate enough shares to tank it and shake out the weak paper hands giving them more ammo.

If you hold and don't touch your commons. You will be part of the largest squeeze and transfer of wealth in history. The fed caused this by this extra liquidity which allowed greed to run rampant. This isn't our fault they double down and never took profits. The greed that was allowed on their behalf was insane here. 138.4% short. This is life changing money for many of us. Myself included. I could pay off debt, student loans, have money for my kids college.

Diamond hands. Buy every dip.

They are trying to distract you with AMC, BB, BBBY. Telling you the squeeze is over when they actually doubled down. They think we are idiots, let's show them how smart it is to double down against people with very little to lose in comparison to them. Don't worry, they will just get a government bail out and do it again. This is our time people.

\---

HYPOTHETICAL STONK HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE $120 TO START THE MASIVE SHORT SQUEEZE, AND HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE $150 TO GET EXPLOSIVE GROWTH.

Listen. $120 was the intraday high from Monday. $150 was the intraday high from Tuesday. We know that short sellers ENTERED NEW POSITIONS, replacing the old shorts who burnt out. That means that almost 100% of them are ALREADY IN A MARGIN CALL as of EOD Tuesday. But their positions haven't been liquidated yet to cover the margin call. Some brokers allow a few days before liquidation, 2-5 days is typical. The only short squeeze we've seen are from before last Friday. The After-Hours explosion from $148 to $220 on Tuesday was AH liquidation of MONDAY margin callers. Essentially, the unlucky fools who shorted under the Monday EOD price of $76.79 (there was a intraday low of $69).

That means if the stock HOLDS above $120 at EOD Wednesday (all the Monday shorts) we'll trigger a wave of margin call LIQUIDATION (ie., the squeeze) from Monday shorts, and if it holds above $150 (all the Tuesday shorts) we'll trigger a MORE massive wave of margin call liquidation, which will take place AH Wednesday, today. The real squeeze will BEGIN.

SO   AT ALL COSTS. GME NEEDS TO BE ABOVE $150.

Many investors are reporting they are unable to buy GME due to unavailability. What should happen is supply & demand kicks in and said buyer has to find a seller at a price they will agree on.

If a hundred trucks are manufactured and each sold for $50k. Lets say you want to buy one, but the cheapest any of the owners will sell for is $65k. You buy it, now the value of the truck is $65k instead of $50k. This is how a free & fair market is supposed to work

What is happening with GME is after the buyer paid $65k for the truck, someone steps in and doesnt allow any truck to be purchased above that price. So, then someone wants to get rid of it and sells one for $40k. Now $40k is the value even though there were buyers at or above $65k. This is the market being manipulated instead of being fair & free.

EDIT: Oh, and Shitadel has taken a similar truck and made it look like the above vehicle, but are selling them cheaper & cheaper to trick the system and lower the price of the truck without ever selling a REAL version",0.2171875,0.45833333299999995

Too many folks are going around on the assumption that margin call means 'game over'. It doesn't, it means we move a step closer to game over as the enemy's assets dwindle a bit more. The game isn't over until you see somebody getting their position forced into closure over lack of funds to cover.

Nah, too much more billions lost if they wait.  

I think that the moass will be already launched by June 9th, and that the price will be so high that only new people who read all DD here will be convinced to buy in.

I can be wrong, but keeping an enter price that low when the vote result will be revealed... it's asking to be eaten alive.

But if it's still in the 1xx by June 9th.... every single pennies that I own will go in, GME will be my bank account and my personal wallet.

Turns out they were only looking for half that amount (for stock buy backs?). Over announce the offering

By selling under the radar, they prevented day traders from timing a sell off when GME pricing got close to $285 which would have been the theoretical  max sell point.

by announcing that offering they also gave retail a belief that gme stocks were inherently worth around $285 at the least preventing a panic sell off 

Furthermore, by selling low key through out the month, they generated free money in a sense that shorts would have attacked and lowered the price anyway. why not make some cash?

https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-completes-market-equity-offering-program

Edit: avg price $157.43

Edit:

This is GREAT news. It shows that the past couple weeks of downward pressure was from GameStop raising capital, not from hedge funds shorting.

1.	Gamestop raised half a billion and that didnt even make a DENT in the price or the sentiment of GME.
2.	Hedge Funds most likely nearly out of ammo.
3.	GameStop paid off all debt and is net cash flow POSITIVE so they will never go bankrupt.
4.	No more downward pressure from the company selling more shares.
5.	$500 M to be used for GROWING the COMPANY.
6.	They helped us buy the DIP for the impending queeze by selling us cheap shares!!

Holy MOLY

Edit: most asked question: but doesnt that help hedge funds cover their short positions?
Answer: take a look at the latest DD on how many shorted shares there could be... HUNDREDS of MILLIONS.

 Gamestop only sold 3.5 Million shares. 

And if you havent seen the sentiment of this sub, GME and WSB subs lately, youll know that apes (and now recently the ANTS!) have been buying the SHIT out of these dips. I sure as hell have been and I hope you have too.

One of the first that tapped in and started nourishing a new business power: The shareholder client. Companies will understand this in the future and will try to replicate it; business models will be remade, everyone will want a base of loyal shareholders clients that will herald the company both on the internet and IRL.

Retail will change everything: From ""dumb money"" to the biggest asset of a company (shareholder clients) in a couple of decades. Now, we are laughed at, berated, even accused; but the tides are changing. People want to be the masters of their own destiny and nothing will stop change.

There will be a lot of copycats:The next GME, the next squeeze, biggest short interest, etc. - the change has already begun and everyone wants a piece. Companies start to understand the power this brings, the global awareness, the brand loyalty, the free marketing that can be achieved.

GRAPEVINE, Texas, April 26, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) (GameStop or the Company) today announced that it has completed its previously announced at-the-market equity offering program (the ATM Offering).  


GameStop disclosed on April 5, 2021 that it had filed a prospectus supplement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to offer and sell up to a maximum of 3,500,000 shares of its common stock from time to time through the ATM Offering. The Company ultimately sold 3,500,000 shares of common stock and generated aggregate gross proceeds before commissions and offering expenses of approximately $551,000,000. Net proceeds will be used to continue accelerating GameStops transformation as well as for general corporate purposes and further strengthening the Companys balance sheet.

Earlier this month, GameStop disclosed that it issued an irrevocable notice of redemption to redeem $216.4 million in principal amount of its 10.0% Senior Notes due 2023 on April 30, 2021. This voluntary early redemption will cover the entire amount of the outstanding 10% Senior Notes, which represents all of the Companys long-term debt.",-0.042777777999999995,0.429444444

I saw my money disappear as the stock went alllll the way back down to $40 but I held on.  I bought more and averaged down every chance I could get.  I would have sold at $777.00...  That was my magic number. That was the price I decided would be HUGE for me and at the time I thought a stock in the millions was nonsense. I just didn't understand it.  Then I saw the stock being manipulated SO MUCH.  I began to think this was a lot more than I thought.  I researched everything and began to understand.  I removed my limit order and my floors.  On the day me and my family drove 3 hours to get the vaccine it skyrocketed again.  After being down for SO LONG I almost paper handed that shit.  I am so sorry, but I did.  We stopped to get the vaccine and during the 10 minutes I went in to get my shot, the stock plummeted down $150.  I am sorry it took me so long, but this is what really convinced me there is major fuckery going on.  I bought more shares.

The Stock Market is basically a Prey hunting trapping game and as I see it goes like this:  
The big guys goes on scavenger hunt and then they zero on a prey target. The company needs to have some interest in their stock. The hunters start to throw foods on the road to attract the prey to dip their toes in the water and have some confidence their shares are growing.  
Increasing the share prices would increase investors (prey) attraction to invest more.   
Then the hunters ask the Market Manipulators to create huge amount of Put options and Call options to make them gain/loss neutral and cover their tracks.  
  
Then the Hunters lend the synthetic shares they created and the short selling begins not at high volume yet, because the goal is to keep selling as much as investors prey keeps on buying. The Prey collects the sold money to grow even larger and more powerful to replicate the plan with other stocks and continue to repeat the trap.  
  
Once they decide that the prey eat enough shares and trapped, hunters flood the market relentlessly of those synthetic shares that appears legit since it is backed by Option put/call. Certainly, some borrowing of the real shares take place as well as that is also part of the trap cover-up to deceive the prey.   
  
Part of the decoy system are Media Bashers, false news manipulators, buying and selling outside the market Blackpool out of shore tradings, fake analysis, bought/bribed regulators and authorities etc.   
  
In short, provide unlimited supply to achieve the target goal of the most favored outcome of driving the company to bankruptcy or at the most to purchase the borrowed and synthetic shares at a much lower rate than the fund collected selling them. Then the regulators may fine the Manipulators a very tinny percentage as a punishment which is tinny skin out of the entire prey.  
  
So historically, the smart prey try to interpret charts and fundamentals which basically buys when the enemy is looking the other way or when the enemy is setting the crumbs on the road to trap the prey then as soon the big trap gets closer, sell and sheer the profit.   
  
Another Prey coping tactics has been is to buy options as much as they can afford to lose and for a short chance.   
  
Another prey coping mechanism is that when they get trapped to return bleeding with broken hopes accepting that this time they miscalculated and go on with less goals in life.  
However, this time is different. The prey decided to turn into Apes and bond worldwide against their aggressors. Apes now start eating the dangled food the aggressors left on the way with courage. Apes realized all food anywhere can be turned into a hidden trap and cost them to get hunted swiftly and decided to focus on one GME and AMC trap food the aggressors set for them. Now the prey trapped the aggressor not as a form of becoming a new aggressor, but as a duty and a right to defend ones own life, family and belongings against the aggressors even if it means bankrupting the aggressor and even jailing them as they have committed robing and stealing in the trillion of wealth against the majority of the people of good well everywhere.   
  
Because the aggressors have done it over and over with great success, Apes must tough it out and stand their ground against the aggressor with resolute.   
  
Now, for me as long as the aggressors are covering with new synthetic shares is not the squeeze at all. The real squeeze is when the manufacturers of the synthetic shares are forced to purchase them at any price the seller determined and born those synthetic shares and every borrowed shares there is. Uncovered borrowed share is a naked share that dilute the market and loot investors.

Welcome to another week of Apes vs Hedgies/Goverment/Media/Haters

This weekend I saw some people on Twitter call this community crazy. Maybe we are but in a good way IMO.

So I just wanted to remind you why GME is a great investment. 

1 - Squeeze Potential 

2 - Company is starting transformation into E-Commerce. Stock price most likely going to be way over 300.

3 - DFV is a legend and he quadrupled down just 3 weeks ago by 50k shares at 155 even though he owned 150k shares already. Say what you want but DFV has been a step ahead of everyone in this thing from the beginning. 

4 - Ryan Cohen. Not much to add about this Canadian genius. He has already put together a great team and we couldn't ask for a better person in charge to lead the transformation.

5 - Stock Market and Wallstreet are corrupt. Fuck the hedgies, government and media. They have been stealing from the poor for decades and have killed numerous companies. They thought GME would be another but DFV and bunch of retarted Apes said NO. Enough is enough. They made a wrong bet and now they are trying to break/bend rules so they don't lose their trillions. 

6 - Ape Community. We have all enjoyed this community ever since this war has started, made many friends along the way and learnt so much more about stock market than we ever could have if it were not for this community. I personally enjoy my time here alot and I am sure many of you do as well.

All in all, IMO GME is a great investment with or without a squeeze. **** the haters. We HOLD until hedgies are bankrupt and or in jail.

3. No volume increase, in which case the price will find and follow a new channel.

Thank you for the post to remind/inform folks about what happened and what was going on at the time. Just some additions from my perspective:

I was new to stocks around September last year and I was frequenting WSB. I remember that there were rumors that GameStop was trying to transition to e-commerce and that the stock was possibly undervalued. Also some random dude decided to yolo his money on that transition (DFV). Also, some dude from Chewy bought in and became a major holder of GME (RC). Honestly, at that time, I thought it was all fucking crazy. I naively thought that GameStop was failing. Of course GME started gaining steam end of last year before spiking in January. I actually bought an option 11/19/21 $25 call in December. At the time, I thought it was a bet on maybe GME making a turnaround after 2021 Q2 earnings. I still have that call 

Also as we all probably know, WSB is all about options with the gain and loss porns being popular. I do distinctly remember that the play for GME was actually not call options, but buying shares because when the squeeze was in possible, no one knows when it will occur. 

Finally, when the January squeeze happened, I remember that people were looking for other squeeze possibilities. As I remember people saw a bunch of stocks that were shorted. Then I think people FOMOd on GME by investing in BB, AMC, and NOK. Although I think there was some DD about BB turning it around based on a partnership with AMZN. 

Anyway, Im just agreeing that GME was the original play based on the e-commerce turnaround which became a short squeeze play and that AMC, as I remember it, was always a secondary play of a possible short squeeze after the GME squeeze in January.",0.004454545,0.542515152

We have the microscope on the daily movement again today. 

I'm streaming the 1 SECOND GME chart, now with Time & Sales down to the MILLISECOND! Accompanied by a live VIX chart, and level 2 GME data. I also have a live stream of this thread on it in-case you wanted to throw it on in the background and still read the comments coming through.

Come chill with friendly apes and get all your data in one place. There is no monetization on it, I'm just trying to do my part in helping in any way I can.

If you have any suggestions for info that can be added on-screen in case we need to go back and look for any reason please let me know.

So they also know that the majority of members floor is hitting 20mill at this point. They also know that in a margin situation the price doesnt matter, positions are covered instantly by a computer hitting the buy button on shares currently available.

Essentially by this public forum of people discussing squeeze mechanics and potential infinite floors (but not collusion or manipulation) its kicked the HFs into overdrive survival mode way bigger than what 2008 was, especially now that regulatory bodies have said no institution is too big to fail.

So they must be sweating to suppress the situation as much as they can, if anyone confirms the situation is fucked and GME is a hedge against any margin call domino effect the buying pressure would pop this instantly.

Thats my tinfoil hat DD. Just because the SEC/DTCC is imposing these rules onto funds doesnt mean they will inact them if the current situation will cause mass damage to themselves, they will still try to alter the position as much as possible before hitting the hammer.

There is absolutely no reason they would be shilling and putting bots everywhere and faking things if they weren't scared.

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that youll see today!!!

They didnt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold > price goes down > the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place > price drops even more > they keep doing that > price drops lower every time > but as long as we hold they werent able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you dont believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore dont sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! Im talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND  )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND  )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

	Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. 	Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. 	A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

	imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. 	Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 3 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Tues or Wed next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 120% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

                                                                    

And of course, this isnt financial advice. Im literally retarded.

Why would people want to go to the movies you ask? (Movie theaters have always done well during recessions if you are concerned about the future, AMC  should be valued around 30$ or more due to inflation; yet the stock is only about 1/3 of that at the moment). 

I bought some AMC at 18; if I can buy in and hold at 18 then you can buy in when its low and watch the gains come in and flow like water! (Thank me later). 

We are going to take AMC, GME, BB, and NOK to the moon! Dont panic, never sell low! I know youve heard this a million times.. HOLD!!

(Buy low, sell high) ... well we arent selling though just yet, we are holding tell these hedge funds fold and we get the funds we DESERVE. Law suites and congress hearings are INCoMinG.

Well, millions of people have been waiting for some the movies that are coming out this year for DECADE(s), 
-Top Gun 
-Avatar 2 (made billions and set records)
-Dune Reboot 
- Matrix 4 
- Cinderella 
- 101 Dalmatians 
- Spawn Reboot 
- Venom 2 
(This is just a few of them) (100s of millions have gone into these movies and guess what they make money, ALOT of it) .. especially the opening week/month in theaters!

Today we have gotten so much publicity (the publicity we got today showed us the hedge fund managers put all their cards on the table, risking jail time for blatant stock manipulation). These hedge fund companies got swallowed alive on Twitter today). They even lost more money on GME despite all of their efforts to destroy it today! 

If ANYONE knows the power of social media its Reddit. WSB has gone up millions of new users;  many new retail investors are coming in to join the war and get on the  to the  !! 

GME, AMC, BB, NOK  (the war just started) and this is far from over; so, tonight is the night where we get ready for the battle tomorrow for our precious Diamonds! Get a little rest and eat some food if you can!! Be mentally vigilant tomorrow! dont get paper hands if you see some high dips; this is the time to buy more and fuck the hedge funds; their strategies as you already know are FUCKED (they have some secret tricks up their sleeves, but so do we)... buy those dips and fuck them where it hurts! 

In all sales jobs we would have a rally with the team before the day to get everyone hyped up! Lets get hyped up this morning guys! Together! Everyone do your part on social media and the comments, if millions of us do we we are just giving ourselves more publicity! We *HOLD* and buy on the dips! 

It was so nice seeing Congress, Celebs and lots of other high profile people being on the retail investors side! 

PS - Psych 101 - you never tell someone they cant do something ie. You cant buy but you can sell (reverse psychology is real) however, this was the only hand the hedge funds could play to keep from loosing everything today.. telling people not to buy is just going to make them want to buy more, and more. DONT BE AFRAID, we are in this war together. We may not win every battle, but we WILL win the war ! Too much publicity not to at this point. See you guys on the moon.

First of all there's no way WSB alone is going to be able to squeeze a market that big.

Second, it's a blatant fact that the silver price is being held down, manipulated. Where's the bloody inflation on the silver chart?

Third, **Citadel doesn't really ""own"" SLV**, they clear brokers whose individual investors do. Hedge funds do not invest in metals, they're not made for that.

Fourth, **it's not because someone you don't like is bullish on something that you shouldn't be**. Yes, even Citron has done magnificent trades. Trading against someone for the sake of trading against someone isn't going to make you money.

Hedge funds are going bankrupt shorting GME. Silver is not going to save them even it it doubles. They lose 30% on GME shares through interest charges alone. Buying PSLV, which requires physical silver in a vault for everyone who buys the fund, is the squeeze. You literally can't buy physical silver anywhere. It has been supressed like no other metal. The 2 guys who tried it by buying 25% of physical silver in the entire world got bankrupted cause they couldn't pay for delivery. Buffet bought at $5/oz and created a squeeze so big the price shot to $50/oz by 2011, essentially turning silver, which was worth jack shit in the 90s (banks wouldn't even touch it) into a legit asset by creating a bull market that lasted a decade and a half. Buying SLV helps Citadel. Buying PSLV exposes the entire corrupt system of precious metals and will fuck over the market because that silver doesnt exist to get delivered. When the depository goes bust for not delivering, the house of cards blows up. PSLV literally released a presser that said physical silver is in an incredible shortage and its hard to even get the ounces.  The S/G ratio is at 65:1 right now. The next support level is 40 or so. Silver will easily hit $35-$40/oz. There is no reason people shouldnt want an easy 25% gain. DFV got shit on when he bought GME a year ago. Its no surprise silver surfers are getting shit on right now. Silver was already up 40% on the year without the meme of a squeeze. Its a bull market regardless of WSB or not.

Infact, if you get locked out of the US market, i would like to point out that gamestop is traded on the borse frankfurt as well. And according to my trader DeGiro, GME had 1,7 million volume on the US exchange, and <44,000 volume in euros. And yknow, if there's a price difference between the US and EU price, the HFT traders will arbitrade that down to equal price. Do with that info what you will.

But i'm TELLING you! The mining deficit is real! The suppression of the gold and silver price is REAL! There has been delivery wall after delivery wall since April 2020 on the Comex. IT WAS NEVER DESIGNED FOR THAT! We even have signs that the LBMA is running out:

Theres also some very smart people who believe China or Russia are somehow behind the silver squeeze as a lot of the industry double counts and fudges their numbers of how much they actually have same way the Wall Street guys were naked shorting they dont have the silver bullion they say they do so if everyone buys they get caught out in the same way and will have to buy back at inflated prices or face severe consequences. The whole market is built on sand with the quicksand being the companies lying about how much silver they have.

For transparency Im still in on gme 6.7 shares @ 200 but it would be silly not to be looking for other opportunities right now and the reason Im so bullish on silver is that by purchasing the bullion it does a much better job of driving price up than in the case of gme.

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because its going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at its highest.

36204,2/1/2021,9:27,2/1/2021 9:27,glkkdis,1612189636,"tldr: Hold your AMC until at least 200. Selling before then will just ruin it for you and everyone else. Today was a victory, but the war has just begun.

Today was an important step in the right direction, and a huge victory for us. AMC closed today at $13.26, much higher than the $9 dollars needed to close the call options in our favor. This means that there simply is not enough shares that the hedge funds can buy to cover their shares. WE WON THE BATTLE.

THE WAR IS NOT WON HOWEVER. The longer we hold our shares, the longer the hedge's will not be able to cover their shorts, and the more the fee's the hedge's will have to pay for not covering their shorts. Eventually, they will be begging us to sell them our shorts. IT IS UP TO USE TO HOLD OUR SHARES. WE MUST WORK TOGETHER. IF WE START UNDERCUTTING EACH OTHER, WE WILL ALL LOSE OUT.

HOLD YOUR AMC SHARES UNTIL AT LEAST $200 A SHARE. THE LONGER WE HOLD, THE HARDER THE GAMMA SQUEEZE. AT 200 WE WILL DECIDE IF WE HOLD AND PUSH FOR HIGHER NUMBERS OR IF WE SETTLE (MOST LIKELY WE WILL HOLD FOR MORE). Remember, the longer we hold, the more the hedge fund bastards will have to pay in fees. We will rinse them out.

HOLD YOUR AMC. DO NOT SELL. DO NOT FALL FOR THE HEDGE'S SCARE TACTICS. THEY WILL SHORT LADDER, PASS FAKE NEWS, WHATEVER THEY CAN TO SCARE YOU INTO SELLING. WE WILL HOLD OUT. DIAMOND HANDS. SET YOUR SELL LIMITS TO 200. WE WILL SHOW JUST HOW STRONG WE ARE TOGETHER. 

This may take a few days. Maybe even a couple weeks. Just look at $GME. But we stand together, and we rise.

Melvin Capital doesnt have shares to gobble up (their private and dont have shares; they have LPs), and Melvin was not short GME in any size. They had a tiny put on GME, which expired last week and no more. Melvin didnt get margin called either; they were facing redemptions and got whacked on their long portfolio which was in a bunch of illiquids. Pt72 and Citadel entered into a revenue sharing agreement, which you NEVER do in a teetering fund. You do that when you expect the fund to outperform.

Source: work at hedge fund and know all of these people. Every hedge fund of size runs a counterparty desk and their sole job is to know exactly whats going on at other banks/hedge funds (your counterparties) - Pt72 and Melvin are telling all desks they are/were fine and this whole thing is kinda funny and weird. Melvin is down for the year, but nowhere near 30% on a gross AUM basis.

And if you really want to argue, go find the source of the rumor that Melvin is short GME. Theres a single 13F from Nov 2020 that shows a $50M GME put....and nothing more. Short positions dont show up on filings, and nobody would know unless Melvin published their short, but that hasnt happened. So where is the source of this rumor? Find it - I dare you. I know news sites are reporting it as fact, but I literally had a reporter from a major financial news outlet asking me if I knew where it came from. I told the reporter, you know were all laughing about this....

Theres no short squeeze - this is a pure-play mania and it will end just like past stock manias....badly.

Lastly, if you dont know how 1) a stock can have 110% short interest and still have a net long exposure, 2) how an individual fund can be short a stock and simultaneously net long, youre gonna get fucked when this corrects.

-

Look at melvins Nov 13F filing. They absolutely had a $50M put, which is a flavor of a short position. That put expired worthless on 1/22. So they told the truth. But my point is that $50M in a $20 billion portfolio is nothingness and definitely wont squeeze shit. GME is trading like $20B to $30B per hour.

This is part of the reason that wall st is laughing: to trigger a squeeze, you need a huge short position relative to the daily volume traded. So if a stock has $10B of shares shorted and trades like $1B per day, thats a great set up for a squeeze. Why? Bc there are not enough shares being traded for a fund to cover their position, so they have to bid up the market to induce more selling supply. Stock price goes up more, and thats a squeeze.

On the other hand, GME is trading the entire short float multiple times per day. Theres simply no way for a squeeze to happen mechanically - there are waaaaaaaay too many shares openly being traded to make it difficult for a fund to cover their shorts. GME is one of the most liquid stocks on the market today. Theres no there there.

NO HEDGE FUND HAS TO BUY IN THEIR SHORTS EVER. WSB has no fucking clue whats going on in reality.

The short interest right now is either 1) options dealers hedging the insane number of puts outstanding (and/or any synthetic positions out), and 2) it is trivial for a sophisticated hedge fund to have a short position in a stock and be net long (profiting when it goes up). In fact, the few funds playing this right now are doing precisely that. Point is, THERE IS NO GUARANTEED SHORT SQUEEZE and no fund is on the clock - hedge funds can work their balance sheets until WSB is a smoldering hole of tendies turned to ashes.

And as for this AMC thing, this is literally hedge funds taking money from WSB - they flipped the converts, and guess who bought it....WSB. Im sure they send their thanks while they are in private planes down to Barbuda.

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.** 

#WE LIKE THE STOCK 

#KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK

It's tempting to look at the current stock price and think it may be a good time to take profits. But that was my mistake 2 days ago. I thought it was going to dip so I sold figuring I'd buy back in at the bottom. Learn from my mistake. It didn't dip. It kept climbing and I'd be up another 50k right now. There is no timing the dip. All the way, the whole way, is the only way.

A lot of people are up a fat chunk of change right now and think ""they're good"" but there is an astronomical fucking megaton of life left in this.

It's explained, very easily, and without much digging.  Both stocks were targeted by hedge fund short sellers so greedy they left themselves vulnerable to a short squeeze. Smart intellectuals at /r/wallstreetbets (the smarter-est) saw this vulnerability and memed and hyped redditors into buying and holding GME and AMC so hard that that the shorts will be squeeze to bankruptcy.  
  
Then, this week, the shorts doubled down on it!  They took loans from another hedge fund to cover the shorts!  That was when gamestop was near 100.  Now gamestop is at 350 (meaning the shorts just lost another 200% of the money so far), and a new massive squeeze just over the horizon.  On Friday, all the options become due.  And given the current price of the stock, millions the options are ""in the money"" where normally they would be worthless. Which triggers forced buying of shares to from everyone who was shorting the stock through options.  How much?  I think something like 20% of the total available gamestop shares are required to cover it.  And the buying by WSB (wallstreetbets) ate up almost all the available shares to buy.  Which means they *might* have to buy stock at 3x, 4x, 10x? times the current price.

Goes into maybe why we didnt see anything happen from the 1/29 calls last Friday and the T+2. Phantom shares diluted the price (plus RH and other brokers restricting) drove the price down. With the failure to deliver the 1/29 calls they have 13 consecutive days to close out a failure to deliver

2/9 will be really interesting to get the short data. I personally dont think this is over yet. But either way I think GME is a company Id invest in anyway and it has great potential. Averaging down might be good

Now this poster is brilliant. Read it understand it pass it along. PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because its going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at its highest.

I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but its all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what youre dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday

My recommendation:

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because its going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at its highest

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

AMC even minted more shares (and sold them at $4 something), which is a smart move, actually. But the result is that shorts don't have to worry about not being able to find stocks to cover their positions. 

Hence, there wouldn't be the same feedback loop that pushed GME to the moon. Don't get me wrong, I think AMC is a viable company in the long run and stock price could be in the $20s in a year or two. And that's when I'm holding AMC till.

Look at the Open Interest (OI) column, this indicates the total number of option contracts that are held by investors in active positions. The Volume represents the number of options contracts being exchanged between buyers and sellers.

There is a huge drop off in options contracts below $15. If BB closes tomorrow below $15, then all these contracts will expire worthless. If BB closes above $30 tomorrow, then all these contracts will be ITM and Wallstreet will have to fork over a pretty penny to pay these out. They are manipulating the stock for their benefit.

Edit: Getting a lot of private messages about this, If you have to ask which option you should buy tomorrow, just buy shares. This is just my person opinion and not professional investment advice.

Edit 2: For those asking if we don't hit $30/$20/$15 today, still hold your positions. Wall Street is trying to scare us into selling. The higher the price today, the maximum the pain to their wallets, but this stock trends with GME/AMC. Once they go up we go up. The squeeze is not over!

Dear SEC and President Biden, I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A.  78i, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States. Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly... To effect... a series of transactions in any security registered on a national securities exchange... or in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement... raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others."" Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A.  78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity: https://preview.redd.it/nmiqx27md4e61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3e61c081b3332670eaa8b972c309c6d56177e33 Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government. Finally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that ""Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in violation... shall be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price which was affected by such act or transaction.""

SEC helping them would cause world wide outrage for one. Many countries and its citizens have invested in this stock and screwing it up or nullifying it would hurt country relations. 

It would also cause business around the world to be less likely to invest or buy into the American Market. As if anyone would invest in a company on the off chance it just poofs into nothing because hedgefunds fucked it up and made a huge scandal.

And if the SEC were to help then toss the current head as a sacrifice, everyone would point to the next head to fix it or worse, call on Biden for accountability. Try telling millions of people you screwed them over cause the hedgefunds were losing money so ya gotta go back to being poor. I'll try harder for you next time. Absolute shit show that could cost them any future political viability. Progressives would never vote liberal due to them being in wall streets pocket. They would be handing over everything to Conservatives in the next 4 years on an election they barely won. Not to be political on this last point as this situation shouldn't be but one cant deny the effects have shockwaves into other parts of life.

Simply put the SEC's best move would be to sit and watch the hedge funds involved blow themselves up and then investigate with a slap on the wrist and make some rules after that will probably restrict retail investors in the future (disguised as protecting them of course).

Edit to fit within the text box  


Dear President Biden,

I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A.  78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States.

Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member of a national securities exchange -- (2) To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, a series of transactions in any security registered on a national securities exchange, any security not so registered, or in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such security, or raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.""

Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A.  78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades) and [https://imgur.com/gallery/Y9TVxCj](https://imgur.com/gallery/Y9TVxCj) Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S.

Sincerely,

AMC is just as heavily shorted and the movies are as equally important as a common man institution as video game stores. And I have my fucking reasons you petulant fuckface. 

1. I love the fucking movies and I reject bankruptcy motivated short sellers who will kill the employment of thousands of people. I reject them, I reject them, I reject them.

2. The principle behind GME is also an attack on inequality through a rejection of our current manipulative financial system. Short selling is not just 75% bullshit, during a pandemic its 150% blood-seeking. Does anyone really believe AMC was headed into immediate bankruptcy without the pandemic.

3. I am an AMC member and continued paying my monthly rate even when AMC was shut down by the pandemic. Why? Because I support businesses I believe in.

I buy Apple, Disney, Microsoft, and a whole bunch of businesses because I believe in them. I also buy AMC because I believe in it.

I love the movies, AMC is near me, and I want it to remain in the area. 

4. I want PRIVATE CAPITAL to give a shit about SOCIAL CAPITAL. In 2008, the public bailed out Wall Street for absolute fraud. And then the banks made obscene money and delivered huge bonuses.

So why can major financial institutions invest in the things that will prop up businesses? Why shouldnt they fucking want to? Why do we need to keep inflating our currency by printing money as a means to prop up the already wealthy?

Why can I scream right back in their face and say STOP BEING AMORAL FUCKS  and Bet On The Recovery that working people need. Bet directly on working people.

This is why I am LONG AMC AND GME.

And fuck the op for his judgmental self-righteous ass-hattery. 

5. Most importantly, AMC is heavily invested in by the movement. You can suppprt it for be left behind. You are welcomed to join but dont tell people not to who believe in the cause. If you do that, then youre know better than CNBC that keeps reporting GME will lose steam, Jim Cramer who recommended that everyone just stop, or Robinhood who restricted my purchase of buying AMC just as much as GME purely because WE WERE WINNING.

Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked. For a stock market investor or trader, that time limit is three days. According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer has not located a share to borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share in the open market. This is called a buyin, and it is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in the market place equal to the number of shares the company has issued.
Market makers have special exemptions from the rules: they are allowed to carry a naked short for up to twentyone trading days before they have to borrow a share. When the share is not borrowed in the allotted time and a buyin does not occur, and they rarely do, the naked short becomes a failtodeliver (of the borrowed share).

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp)

>During the financial crisis of 2008, failures to deliver increased. Much the same as check kiting, where someone writes a check but has not yet secured the funds to cover it, sellers did not surrender securities sold on time. They delayed the process to buy securities at a lower price for delivery. Regulators still need to address this practice. 

What I can assume is that there was a lot of naked call selling during this time and whoever sold the calls is struggling to buy the actual shares needed to fulfill the call options contract.

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.
2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.
3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.
4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.
5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.
6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.
7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that [/u/draemon\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/draemon_/) provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.\*

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are forced sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or prop desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing volatility**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated dumps of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

 1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

 2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

 3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

 4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

 5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

 6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

 7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.

 8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

 9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

I've been reading up a bit, and from what I understand the Estimated Short Interest on GME has hovered around 70 million USD for the last few days, with an apparent drop to 38 million friday according to ortex.com. 

So, over the course of say 4 weeks, that would be an interest of anywhere between 760 - 1400 million. At the same time, covering all the outstanding shorts at the current share price, would roughly be 17 billion. If the share price were to fall to say $250 however, it would already be 4 billion less. Doesn't that mean that essentially mean that for the short sellers, the best proposition is to just pay the interest for a month or two, hoping the price goes down? I mean, trying to close the position now would only drive up the share price and their daily expenditure no? 

Also, what makes people think the price might go up to say $1,000 or $5,000? I understand the fundamental idea of dictating the price because of scarcity, but I just don't understand why the short sellers would come into a position where they ""have"" to buy. As I understand it, these shorts don't expire. So what mechanism are people pointing at that forces short sellers to try and close out their position? Is it because the broker will want the shares back because they think the liquidity of the short seller is becoming in question?

Could be that I'm missing something very obvious here, or getting some basic stuff wrong. As I said, I don't really know much about this, but now that I'm ""in"" (just a few shares, if it evaporates it's fine), I'd like to understand it better.

Edit: Also, Melvin Capital apparently manages about 13 billion in assets and they got an injection of 2,5 billion. That makes me think that if the stock stays anywhere near these levels, they will simply go bankrupt instead of covering their shorts? There may be other short sellers apparently, but ultimately, the money has to come from somewhere and if the squeeze happens and people want to convert, will it not simply be that the short sellers will not be able to cover their position at all?",0.037089646000000004,0.412477453

First of all, I want to start by saying that some hedge funds are shady fucks. There are a lot of things they did illegal. Here are a few examples:

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp)

Now I want to address some of the misconceptions that new traders have about the markets.

1. **I was not allowed to buy shares on RH they wanted to drive the price down!?**

DTCC, the clearinghouse for WeBull, RHand other brokerages, recently raised the collateral requirements for GameStop transactions to nearly 100%.

When RH takes a buy order it goes to it's clearinghouse to exchange it's clients money for shares. The shares are immediately and conveniently transferred to the client, but the funds arent transferred for 2 days. There's this gap between the broker and the clearinghouse for these unsettled trades that the clearinghouse will require some cash upfront (margin) for but otherwise accepts exposure for the rest.

If the stock being bought is extremely volatile, expensive and has a huge amount of recent volume and therefore unsettled trades, the clearinghouse will eventually realize they are floating quite a lot more to the broker than they are comfortable with on the back of a very risky equity. GME fits all these characteristics. It's this point in the GME scenario where DTCC sets margin requirements to 100%. They tell their brokers, ""Hey if you want to get GME stock from us, we will not accept your word that this trade will settle in two days. Instead we need the money upfront since we are already way too exposed to this one ticker from you.""

Now, if RH wants to continue filling buy orders for it's clients it needs to come up with ALL the money for each trade. RH does not have nearly enough cash on hand to handle this, hence the recent draw down from of RH's credit lines as they try to get enough liquidity to keep buying shares for their clients. Eventually the brokers just don't have enough cash, throw in the towel and stop accepting buy orders until they can settle more trades or the clearinghouses release the margin requirements for these stocks.

The concept that RH would fuck over basically their entire user base on purpose to help a minority investor's minority investment in a hedge fund that already closed their fucking short position doesn't stand up to even the smallest amount of scrutiny. It's just a boring case of the market plumping going wild because it's not built to handle pumps of this scale.

**2. But I was allowed to sell!**

Of course you were. Selling is exiting an already created position. The liability that RH would get if you were not able to sell and the price went down would be insane. They can not stop you from selling an asset that you own. They can, however, block the purchasing of new assets through their platform.

**3. But Fidelity and ThinkorSwim allowed people to buy and sell.**

Thinkorswim and Fidelity own their own clearing houses and have enough shares to satisfy the orders. Also, they do not need to pay collateral since they are a clearing house.

**4. Okay, but what about the 120% short interest, Melvin will be closing their position soon, and a short squeeze will happen.**

Melvin already closed their position. There was enough volume for them to do so.

The short interest are just estimations. Short interest information gets released on 15th and 30th of each month. Next week we will be able to see the short positions.

Hedge funds keep taking short positions and are much better prepared for now, because there is more money to be made on riding a stock down to 40 from 400, then from 5 to 1.

Many hedge funds are also riding the wave up, and have long positions in GME. Blackrock, one of the biggest money managers already made insane profit, and will probably ride this on a way down.

**5. But a short squeeze will happen!**

It could, or it could not. The interest in not high to a point were they will go bankrupt or have to buy back the shares to cover. They can comfortably hold for 6-12 month as long as they dont get margin called, which I dont expect them too, tbh. The payoff makes sense, think about it this way. The interest is I think 30% yearly. Lets say you short a billion dollars worth GME. You pay annual interest of 30-40%. Hedge funds definitely have enough money to pay that 300 million a year. Now, lets say in a year a price goes down from 400 to 40. A fund will make essentially 900 million dollars minus the interest fee and etc. it is a no brainer for some bigger funds to take this position and enjoy their easy 40% profit.

Considering many funds have insane amounts of collateral, they will not get margin called from this.

**6. But if options expire in the money they have to sell their shares!**

A lot of options expired ITM on Friday, so why did the price not go up?

Well, how many retail investors that were holding their options actually had enough money to buy 100 shares at a strike price? Not too many.

**7. Okay, but Hedge funds are still bad and evil!**

Sure, I agree. Some are. Some hedge funds get their funding from managing pensions and endowments funds.

**8. But Citadel was manipulating the markets!**

Citadel and Citadel securities are two separate LLCs. They are only allowed to open long positions, they can not short a stock. One is a market maker that processes option orders and has no say in the markets. In fact, the more volume there is, the more money they make on the spreads. Would jot be surprised if Citadel made a lot of money on market making in the past week.

**9. But Hedge funds are insane investors with 50% annual return.**

Not necessarily true, an average hedge fund has been underperforming for the past 20 years. You probably had better returns then them just by investing in index funds. Don't get me wrong, a lot of smart people work in the funds, but their main goal is to hedge, in other words, be safe from market movements in any direction.

**TL;DR**

Hedge funds are bad, but they are not retarded (except for Melvin, who overextends on a short at $5)

But many of the rules that came in play were written decades ago, they were not take from thin air. Because against hedge funds is good, but throwing different theories that will be easily disapproved once they file 13F will not take them down. Knowing how markets work, and being vigilant is how you make more money than hedge funds.",0.021477896,0.502452053

After ten green bars you start to worry. Diamond Hands you tell yourself, but your getting anxious. You try not to look at the rising price, and consider locking your phone, but that only makes your stomach ache. The short squeeze accelerates. Its been three minutes. Money begins to physically pour out of your phone. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of $100 bills. You try to shovel it into the tub but it builds up too fast. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cash from escaping. The air grows thin, rapidly displaced by the impossible flow of cash. The short squeeze accelerates. You slip and fall in the anomalous stream of bills, pouring from your phone. The cash is now six inches deep, and you struggle to put down your phone, but alas, you hands have solidified into perfect diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cash rapidly exiting your phone, stuck in your hand and impossible to put down, begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a money printer themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cash is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of greenbacks reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with money instead of molasses. The short squeeze accelerates. Its been ten minutes. Your children and wife scream in rapture as their bodies are engulfed by the freshly minted freedom bucks. Your youngest child goes under, with equal parts delight and horror, and muffled cries rising from the churning cash pool. You pray to DeepFuckingValue to finally sell, so you can follow suit. The short squeeze accelerates. You squeeze your eyes shut to stop the eldritch sight of so much money pouring from your phone, but it does not care if you witness it. It can not be contained. The force of the money propels you with such force you feel a sense of weightlessness as you accelerate off the ground. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the uncrumpled bills. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a birds eye view you see your house is completely buried in money. Your neighbor calls the SEC. The short squeeze accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray bundles of money hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The short squeeze accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. The billionaire class has ordered your execution, and hundreds of guns fire on you, yet you remain unharmed, being forged from diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. It has been two hours. With your ape-like body now entirely composed of Diamond, the money begins to spray as if directed by a rocket nozzle. You break the sound barrier. The government, pressured by WallStreet, deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cash flow sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the Earth. You feel your lungs start to burn, as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new green paint job as you fly past. Physicists and economists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The short squeeze accelerates. The money begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of cash. Astronomers begin calling you the GME Rocket. You are lost in space, heading roughly in the direction of Andromeda. You wonder, briefly, if perhaps you should hit the Sell button. A small voice in the back of your shattered mind whispers...

40161,1/30/2021,12:16,1/30/2021 12:16,glcp3mx,1612026981,"To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) : AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.

Todays target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when theyre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.

But this isnt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and theres a lot more room to grow. On the high end were talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.

Been considering jumping in with you on a few highly shorted stocks just for fun; overall I'm a traditional buy-and-hold in the medium to long term guy but there's a tidal wave of change happening.  For some perspective for newbies:

Big hedge funds **borrow** shares of companies they consider ""overvalued;"" that is, likely to drop in price because of  poor fundamentals, lousy management, changing technology, whatever (think about the Blockbuster Video rental chain if you're old enough).  Many people, including me, think that GameStop also has lousy fundamentals and a broken business model.  When is the last time YOU bought a game there??

If/when those comanies' shares drop in value, the hedgies can buy them at a low price and ""cover"" their short position and pocket the difference in stock price from where they borrowed to where they cover.  This is classically known as ""shorting"" or ""selling short"" a stock.  

If the value of those companies instead goes **up**, the hedgies have to at some point repay the owners of the stocks they borrowed with shares bought at a higher price (so they lose money - the higher the price they have to buy at, the more they lose).  Their downside is limitless - if a share goes from $10 to $1000 and they are forced to cover, they have lost 100x what they put in.  At some point a fund gets out because it can't afford to lose any more (again, unlimited downside), which is what started happening with Gamestop (GME) last week.  

GameStop (GME), as a highly shorted stock, was/is a great target for WSB to focus on as it was highly shorted.  Hedge funds who bought the stock at a low price have been forced to ""cover"" their positions at a much higher price.  Because of all the retail investors (us) were buying, there weren't many shares around to borrow, so the hedgies had to buy no matter what the price (a ""short squeeze"").

BUT, think about this: it's all a game of chicken.  If a hedge fund has unlimited cash on hand, it will short GME **even more** now, because of it's meteoric rise.  A year ago, with GME trading at 4 dollars a share (yes, really), all a hedgie could make was MAX $4.00 per share, IF the company's stock went all the way to zero, which virtually never happens.  Now, if another hedge fund decides to jump in and short GME at $400, it's upside, or potential profit, is **up to $400/share**.  This is the ultimate catnip: the higher the share price, the more money that shorting it can make IF it goes down.  This also means that for retail investors (that is, you and me), buying here has a lot of both potential upside (if more hedge funds are forced to cover) and downside (if the hedge funds can hold out and keep shorting until it goes down).",0.034377778,0.42962222200000005

Around that time, people were talking big about how Nikola Motors was going to change the world, and that people needed to buy OTM LEAPs immediately. I was new and didn't really know what to make of the buzz. But I saw the morning of June 8, that some OTM options had gone up over 10,000%.

Not much time after that, I saw buzz about an internal email leak in Telsa motors that many interpreted as meaning the company was going to have S&P inclusion soon. Then next morning, TSLA stock started running up. I jumped in and got out with a modest 2.5x gain. But I analyzed my trades and looked back and I could have had a 125x gain easily if I played it differently. Note, TSLA was not included into the S&P this time.

Another time I was here and I saw people talking about how Kodak was going to be given a big federal loan related to covid. The stock had jumped from 2.62 to about 8 and I was a little confused about the information and I thought it had already been announced and so the main jump was over. That night, the news confirming what I was seeing was a rumor dropped, and some options again jumped over 10,000%.

Then there was the time that TSLA did get included into the S&P. Huge run up and huge gains.

There's also the purple mattress thing but honestly I didn't follow it too well.

Now there's GME. I have been playing it and have done extremely well. I'm not out either, but I have a large amount of realized gains so I don't have to worry about the money I still have in it.

When my reddit account was created i bet my life savings to GME, it was only 2k, i ask my mom if i can do stocks, she just give me a yes, she doesnt know what a stock is, or if the thing she sign was a contract with a broker or a marriage document.  
At that day i bought 7 shares of gme around the 260 a share, next day i wake up and see that gme was going to the fucking moon, i dont remember how much a share was at that point, i just remember how 5 minutes later GME was going to THE FUCKING FLOOR, so as a noob trader with gme being my first stock i sold my 7 shares and lose 1k, at that point i reconsider and decided to buy again, at that point i just can buy 4 shares, so i did, i didnt have more cash so i started saving money again and 3 or 4 days ago when gme went to 120 a share i down my position and buy another 3 shares again to have my fucking 7 shares.  
Now i am just waiting to watch each share at 200k and buy a girlfriend or something.

Ok folks, the time is upon us, market closed at $146 and by the time of writing this the prices of shares are $208 EACH!!

This is insane, but it is important to all newbies who want to make a quick buck to know why everyone is shouting ""HOLD"" and ""DIAMOND HANDS"" and ""DON'T SELL"" all the time.

The fact of the matter is this: When the short squeeze happens, the people who shorted the shares for GME will be FORCED TO BUY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE PRICE. Once this happens, demand will increase, triggering the next wave of shorters to cover their positions and buy at THE NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE.

                   

Now what I'm going to say next is possibly the most important part of this whole post: WE COLLECTIVELY CONTROL THE PRICES AT WHICH THE SHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARES. That's right, if 100% of people who owned shares in GME right now were to set their limit sells to $1000, then the shorts would be forced to buy at that price to cover their positions. This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

DON'T BE SCARED!! So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win. (If you want to of course this is not financial advice ;))

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves.

They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.

1.	**Shares**

Buy em, hold em, **dont sell em**. Its going to be a bumpy ride and most of ya rookies dont got the testicular fortitude for seeing wild swings in your portfolio. Shares mitigate that. The next part is of the utmost importance. **YOU PUT A LIMIT ORDER IN FOR YOUR SHARES**. Why? Because unbeknownst to you, your broker will loan these for ridiculous fees of which you get nothing (as high as 84% today). Willing to bet most of you paste eaters had no idea about this. Yep, the game is rigged against you. But they cant loan them if youre trying to sell them. Just put whatever price in you want ($1,000 or $420.69). This is moot if youve been shares cash only.

2.	**Weekly calls**

Buy a call thats 1 or 2 strikes OTM from the current stock price. Why? Because a large MM just sold you that call. Your broker sells your order flow to MMs so they can make money. The game is rigged against you. To offset his risk the MM will then go buy an amount of shares corresponding to the option delta. 0.80 Delta = MM buys 80 shares. The closer your option is to the strike price, the more MM has to buy in the market. This is a basic understanding of the term Gamma Squeeze you just heard about yesterday.

3.	**Multi-leg approach**

>Sell a cash secured put 1-2 strikes OTM

>Use the money you got from selling the put to buy a call 1-2 OTM

Now the MM will buy shares to cover both the call and put. Double the gamma. Double the fun.

And just remember. **WE LIKE THE STOCK**. We did not short this stock. We buy this stock because we know its undervalued. We believe in using our money to power good companies in a free market economy. We did everything right in the market. They played stupid games and won stupid prizes. We go to the moon.

Before GME became the meme stock that everyone knew about, it was a frequent topic of discussion on WSB. But, these discussions were almost always two sided: one side sure that GME would go to the moon and the other side sure that it would crater. Furthermore, it wasnt the only stock that was talked about. 

Then the end of January happened and the stock became I became international news. Within a week WSB went from being a sub of <2,000,000 members to having 9,000,000 subbed. 

And the new GME people were **active**. All other discussions were getting drowned out. The original members were getting upset that it was GME all the time. After several days, I think the mods finally started to clamp down on low value posts (posts where basically the entire message contained no information besides HODL). Lots of posts were from people who had no idea what they were talking about. And anyone offering a view that wasnt considered pro-GME would get massively downvoted. Basically a cult was developing to the point where WSB was just GME. 

Also, as another poster mentioned, there was a mod turnover (some mods were in talks with folks to do a movie deal in secret until another one of the mods blew the whistle  Reddit eventually had to get involved). 

Im not sure when r/GME became a thing, but I want to say that it was early February. The WSB mods from February to March have done an amazing job of clamping down on posts and its moving to something closer to what it used to be. 

For what its worth, we still talk about GME on r/WallStreetBets . Its just that the hurdle to get a post to go anywhere is much higher (which IMO is a good thing). 

I havent been on GME much, but what little Ive seen is that it is very much in the vein of r/conspiracy. Lots of speculation, lots of BS, and no real voice of reason. In other words, a giant echo chamber.",0.09484497800000001,0.531885522

All this insider trading, blatantly illegal shit ruining people's lives, blowing up worthless companies or shorting perfectly good companies into the ground was making me sick. I left and never looked back. 

I joined WSB for the memes but then found out you can easily sift through the wheat from the chaff. GME caught my eye and I went in for the money. I never expected this to happen. At this point it's no longer about the money for me, but sending a message. 

A family friend is a finance professor and he once said to me, ""hey you know what I like to watch? National Geographic. You wanna know why? To remind me what we are. We are all animals, the strong eat the weak, tearing the faces off those that cannot fight back. Don't ever forget that it's a cold hard world out there."" 

When 2008 happened who got arrested? Nobody. They kept repeating no institution is too big to avoid investigation but they did absolute fuck all. Top execs still got away with enough money to buy private jets. Money that was people's entire life savings. People that needed that money to survive, for medicine, for their children's education, for getting out of crushing poverty, to get out of the endless cycle of debt and compound interest. 

Now they have the audacity to call us criminals? What fucking hypocrisy. 

Stand with me now brothers. Stand with me and hold until they bleed out of every orifice. Send them a message that we will take this no longer. Either we fold and go back to the rich endlessly robbing the poor, or we stand our ground and say no, no more.

Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to tap down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold its only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, Ive lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. Its a classic short move.

If you dont think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up arent calling in favors like this right now youre living in fucking fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. Its only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price.

If you wake up and see $100 and your heart falls out your pussy and you get paper hands, game over. If you see $100 and instead remember how fucking jazzed you were when it first hit that and hold, you win baby.

If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. Theres no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

&#x200B;

So, Melvin capitol and other hedge funds short sold $GME. Meaning that they borrowed a certain amount of $GME Shares at a certain price. Their plan would be to wait until $GME price fell, and then to buy up at that lower price, pay back the shares they borrowed, and keep the difference.

 ie borrow (for example) 100 shares at (hypothetically) $20 a share and wait until it dips to... say... $15. they could then buy 100 shares at $15 return the 100 shares. Making a $5 profit per share($500) \[This of course is at a much larger scale than 100 shares\]

The one issue they have is they short sold over 138% of the $GME Stock. Meaning, there are 38% more shorts than there are shares... They cannot possibly buy the shares needed to pay their debt.

They can do their best to buy up all the stock, but as long as people hold/buy $GME the hedge funds will bid higher and higher, ***hypothetically*** it does not have a ceiling. 

this is all of course incumbent on the majority of people NOT giving up their positions.

Eventually, humans will be humans and jam the printer...

1. Ryan Cohen. He bought about 13% stake in GameStop and I truly think he could be taking them in a new direction. This man is an ecommerce genius and the founder of Chewy (which he sold to PetSmart for $3.35 billion. He penned an open letter to gamestop (which I encourage you to read) where he made some very good points.

2. The squeeze has not squoze. Melvin capital received billions of dollars in bail out money from Citadel, and guess what they did. They doubled down on their short position. At this point, I think they're challenging our retard. And we've been retarded for way longer than they have.

3. Lot of shorts expire this Friday, forcing the price up up and up.

4. It's the highest shorted stock on the market. At 147 fucking %. The math is simple, if we hold, the stock goes up. 

5. This is your one chance to fuck the dudes who consistently fuck everyone else on a daily basis. Bleed these hedge fund bitch boys dry. Idk about you, but for me, this is personal.

6. We are winning and they are scared. Why else would they lash out like this? They know we have them cornered and they want us to fall apart. These autists think they are better than you and refuse to admit they fucked up big. They claim we need to be regulated for manipulating the market when it's the very thing their careers are built upon.

7. If u/deepfuckingvalue can hold, so can you.

8. We are literally making history. There will NEVER be another stock like this one.

9. Your wife's bf will be pissed if you sell, don't do that to him after everything he's done for you.

10. Apes together strong

11. WE LIKE THE STOCK

Yall need to understand that there is no set time frame for the funds to return the shares, as long as they are paying the margin interest. That being said, brokers can force funds to close positions but this is an uncertainty. 

Bottom line is, as long as we **hold**, Wall Street is bleeding in margin interest until they give in. Nobody knows when that will happen, or whether that will happen gradually or instantaneously. What we do know is: the majority of shares have not been returned, so as long as we hold, the short squeeze **will happen**.

EDIT:

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME

Look up any normal company and see what normal borrowing fees are like (0.3%), GME borrowing is sitting at astronomical rates. Funds are bleeding just from margin interest alone, end game shouldn't be far away anyways. Please for all that is good: hold.

Explanation to hopefully stop panic selling:

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to tap down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold its only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, Ive lowered the stock price by $100 effectively. Its a classic short move.

*If you dont think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up arent calling in favors like this right now youre living in fucking fantasy land.*

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. Its only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price.

*If you wake up and see $100 and your heart falls out your pussy and you get paper hands, game over. If you see $100 and instead remember how fucking jazzed you were when it first hit that and hold, you win baby.*

If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. Theres no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

Please share and upvote this for god sakes so people dont think everyone else selling out and giving up!!!! Please someone who can post copy and post this I dont want credit I just dont want the little guy to lose!

SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD BUY BUY BUY 

UPVOTE AND SHARE 

In the last hour of trading, some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like its selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them. 

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isnt. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, its unlikely that its anyone at all.

Feel free to use my complaint summary if you agree:

Robinhood has gone against the fiduciary duty of its market client base, along with his companys motto of democratizing finance for all by participating in market manipulation. Robinhood has banned the purchase of several NYSE listed equities securities including GME, AMC, BB, and NOK. This is a mockery of the United States foundational characteristic of free markets. Clearly, Robinhood, along with other similar broker dealers, have no interest in the free market or for individual investors. Rather, they serve the interests of hedge fund corporations who have most likely persuaded these firms to engage in market manipulation in order to mitigate losses enacted by short selling. An investigation into Robinhood and similar broker/dealers, along with the hedge funds who have recently lost profits due to their negligent short positions in the stocks mentioned above should take place in order to preserve whats left of the American democracy.",0.012878788,0.429545455

It just hit me and it makes sense. Each day this week the shorts have tried a new and different tactic. Todays tactic is to only allow selling on Robinhood. That is 

HOWEVER!

We still hold ALL the actual cards in our diamond hands. We will not waiver. We will not be intimidated. We will buy buy buy cuz WE LIKE THE STOCK and it just went on SALE!!! GME IS ON SALE!

Obviously theyre gonna make it seem like its tanking this morning to force the weak knees to fold. That will NOT BE US.

Edit: This is all PSYOPS guys. To Wall Street, this is WAR. I can speak a bit from experience here. I am a Submarine Officer. Tactics is what I think and breathe. This is AMAZING to see outside of my usual goings on under the sea (darling it's better, down where it's wetter).

Here is their playbook.

Monday: Thought WSB was a joke and didn't care much. Tuesday: Caused dips at regular intervals hoping for panic sells to cover shorts. (Testing our resolve and defenses) Wednesday: Fucked with brokerage services and Reddit to cause us to lose communication ability and hamper our ability to attack (buy buy buy). Thursday (you are here): Took away (for now) our ability to buy on RH. BIG FUCKING DEAL! We can trade elsewhere in the truly free market. Friday until Forever: GET FUK'd.

We know they will play dirty and break the law. Their choices are: cover, admit defeat and lose so much money they go bankwupt. OR, break the laws, be shady AF, and HOPE to outmaneuver us and out gun us.

They only forgot one smol detail. WE ARE RETARDED!

They can only even borrow 75,000 more shares to short. THEY WILL HAVE TO COVER! The battle is almost won! Don't sell until at least 2/12!

Isn't it interesting that no one on CNBC is talking about the Gamma Squeeze? I haven't heard a SINGLE mention of it. Yet... that pops off again on Friday! Numbers/Math aint capable of lies but PEOPLE and MEDIA certainly are. Hold your nerve!

Melvin has unlimited loss potential on GME. Their shorts don't expire, naked shorting, 140$ short interest, their weekly and monthly expire on friday and all we need to do is hold onto our shares so that they can't have them and INFINITE SQUEEZE JUST FUCKING HOLD.

They got themselves into an infinite loss scenario doing illegal things because they got greedy and now all we have to do to LITERALLY NAME OUR PRICE is hold shares and not sell and they are forced to give us money infinitely, government bailout and all.

HOLDING UNTIL $69420.00 PER SHARE. Fuck you Wall Street. We're taking our fucking money back

EDIT2: I don't know a day. I don't know how long it will go. I do know that there's nothing they can do, nowhere for them to go if we hold.

Funds can sell of shares at progressively lower lots to tap down prices. And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold its only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, Ive lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. Its a classic short move.

If you dont think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up arent calling in favors like this right now youre living in fucking fantasy land.

So for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. Its only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price.

If you wake up and see $100 and your heart falls out your pussy and you get paper hands, game over. If you see $100 and instead remember how fucking jazzed you were when it first hit that and hold, you win baby.

If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. Theres no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue. Shorts are likely fucked

43135,2/2/2021,0:16,2/2/2021 0:16,glnfsq2,1612242986,"**Summary**

As soon as the market opened, Melvin Cuntiple & Co did a short ladder attack, this worked in lowering the price of GME to $213 but it did not increase the volume of shares being sold.

2 hours after opening the price of GME went up $276, clearly the short ladder attack did not work!

After that the price slowly went down slowly to $225 at close.

**Why did this happen**

Despite the share price falling slowly over the day, it is not something to worry about because volume of shares traded averages out to 100 per share. Since these are exact shares we know they're still trying to do their ladder attack but over a slightly longer period of time. You can check the volume of shares traded [here](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades). The main point is since shares are sold in either 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 quantities we know it's a ladder attack.

We also saw CNBC state that redditors had moved over to silver. That is FAKE NEWS, this is one of their last dirty tricks against us APES but it's not working. They're currently shitting themselves too.

**Why didn't the price of GME go to the moon yet?**

There are two reasons for this.

Firstly, some brokers like RobinDaHood placed limits on how much GME you could order whereas other brokers like Trading 212 and Etoro just crashed all day. (Make sure you clear any stop losses at 20% because these cunts won't stop at anything to make sure lose.

Secondly, it seems like a lot of fellow APES are switching over to Fidelity and it can take a few days for funds to get accepted into the account, or something like that. I'm sure someone in the comments will know the exact answer. Anyway, these delay of funds has essentially slowed the buying. So once accounts get cleared which should be by Thursday I believe, we should start to see the price rise past $400 quite quickly.

**Our Gameplan**

So those hedge fuckers know once people's accounts get accepted on Fidelity etc that they're fucked. They will try every trick in the book until Thursday or whenever APES can start buying again.

Our gameplay is very simple APES

Just keep HOLDING

Play some video games, watch some videos of bankers crying idk but just keep HOLDING

In a few days more APES will buy GME and the price will start to increase quite quickly

JUST KEEP HOLDING AND APES GO MOON WHEN MORE APES BUY GME ",0.017238562,0.417985528

The corrupts at wall street have had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Trying to create hype about silver to distract us, using their media contacts to distort the narrative, scaremongering... has it worked? Fuck no!

What they are now doing is using a reduced form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. In other words they will continue to trade between themselves at a level that will keep the stock stagnant. This will be a futile attempt to deceive us that the game is up (excuse the pun) and that the squeeze is over.

People, the squeeze is just getting started! It has barley begun! They will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our stock.

They are continuing to drive the price down now aftermarket in attempt to create further panic so that people sell tomorrow. This is exactly what they want. DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!

HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART; No matter what people say, what you hear in the media or any other form of bullshit distraction...

THEY CANNOT CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS UNLESS WE SELL. Simple as that. Its mathematics. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares. Bottom line.

They cant get out of this without buying the shares back. And who controls the price at which the buy back? WE DO!

Everyone just take a step back, chill out, block out the noise and absolutely 100% hold every bit of stock you own. We are winning here. It really is that simple.

If everyone can stay cool and follow this advice, we got this.

Please upvote, share etc. Dont care about karma or anything this is far more important. The message needs to be spread so that we can do whats necessary and finally get ours. Weve spent too long being oppressed by this corrupt system. Its time for change.

GME & AMC are the main focus. Anything else is a distraction.

LETS DO THIS!!!

I am not a financial advisor just your average idiot. This is my first time on reddit but I have been investing for about eight years or so. There is so much noob negativity and bot bullshit flying around this subreddit. Spend a few hours researching and doing a deep dive on this movement you will easily understand. First thing you need to know is HOLD. We have all the power here. The hedgefund assholes are losing money everyday. They know they are fucked and are doing everything in their power to stop us. They are trying to scare us with short ladder attacks and the corrupt main stream media. I know the noobs reading this are concerned about the payout but this thing is much bigger than that. If you dedicate yourself to the cause and ride this thing through, ya you might make a pretty penny. At this point it has become a revolution. The student has become the master. Us youngins are ready to show these baby boomers that we are ready to take control of this goddamm corrupt world. The passing of the baton is now. Buy the fucking dips and hold on for dear life. Apes strong together. Send this thing to the fucking moon and beyond.

##The first one is this:

https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/interactive-chart

This link provides the information about todays volume. The volume represents the trades that are happening. And today the volume has been really low. This means people are not selling. We have been holding, which should drive the price up.

##The second one is this:

https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml

This link provides the information about todays supply/demand considering buy and sell orders (on fidelity). The demand is WAY too high for the supply to meet, which should also drive the price up.

##The third is this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8ox3/at_these_levels_its_not_about_the_price_of_the/

Hedge funds are ""fraudulently creating more shares"" and retail are holding. They are using very ugly tactics in order to bring the price down to a number that satisfies them since even $225 is beyond the amount they are prepared to absolutely-have-to-fucking-pay.

Please stay educated. Do not trade emotionally. And lastly get some rest. We do not know when this shitshow will end. But hopefully we will have left a stain of hope in history behind us.

Please feel free to repost this to infinity. It may satisfy alot of people (like myself) who feel extremely anxious after today, and need a pat on the shoulder.",-0.047385620999999996,0.504640523

I get it, Its scary, it is tempting, but diamond hands boys. This is a movement, and the bonus is the money. You dont wanna miss out on this shit. Last week we recovered a dip to 120 on GME. We can do this.

To all the small stock owners. You matter too.Collectively, we have managed to take half of these suits money. I have no doubt in my mind we can get out ahead. Think about the number, BILLIONS!!! 20 BILLION!!! Itll get spread across us all like my mothers sweet cheeks. It will happen. It could take longer than expected, and the hype could die down, but KEEP HOLDING!!! Well be swimming in pool of tendies in no time!

43473,2/2/2021,2:23,2/2/2021 2:23,glny2nb,1612250590,"Heres some unsolicited advice from an old salty sea dog like myself. For all the  newbies who are tempted to sell right now. 

1. Fucking DONT. Its simple, if you sell right now you give leverage to the hedges. You give them actual shares to work with. These dips are artificial and are caused by hedge funds trading the same shorted securities back and forth for Lowe and and lower prices. These idiots are playing the game with Disney-bucks. We have leverage now. 

2. Fuck THEM. Seriously, fuck these guys. They are the same cocksuckers that bent you and the rest of the world over a barrel in 2008 and again during the peak chaos of COVID. These motherfuckers made TRILLIONS, with a **T** while you got $1800 over a year at best. 

3. Fucking CHILL. This is not the end of the world. You have a **STOCK** not an **OPTION** it is literally impossible for you to lose money unless you sell for less than you bought for. This entire process can last for days, weeks, or months. If you bought in for $300 and it drops down to $200, buy more, you will **average down**. You could average all the way down to tree fiddy per share and sell for  $4.20 and *you will still profit*. 

There is no expiration to these shares as long as GME remains a company. Ride it out, make a profit, and tell the suits to get fucked. 

This is not financial advice. Its an invitation for the SEC to take Wall St.s dick out of their mouth and slob on my hog instead.

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

I slept in a recliner up until my family was evicted. Walmart moved to my hometown and closed the surrounding stores including the local $GME. Then the Walmart went out business and the city is fucked.

I made it out by taking nearly 100k of student loans and I have a pretty good life other than the student debt. Then I get married, moved to a town with a beautiful $AMC right around the corner. 

GameStop, my childhood store to line up at midnight and buy halo 2 with my life savings, was crumbling due to these dick sweaters. 

Now AMC is struggling to survive, all with their dine in options, beautiful comfortable recliners and 4K projectors. Yes a worldwide pandemic happened, but worse? The billionaire thumb riders jacking off hard to business failures. Businesses that bring joy to many, so they can be even more rich while everyone else loses joy-opportunities. 

So first off fuck Walmart, fuck these pig dick licking billionaires for fucking our house from us several moons ago, and fuck the media for making it seem like we did something wrong.

This morning Im going all in on AMC and GME. I hope at least someone reads this and gets inspired like I did after lurking for so long. Seems like a lot of us retards got hit in similar ways. Time to take the power back! Power to the players! I got sharp AF  and I dont give a fuck.

It is absolutely disgraceful and reprehensible that Trading 212 is not allowing people to buy shares in GME. This is market manipulation to the core. Thankfully, there are a couple of ways around it.

1. Currently, it is possible to purchase GME shares on Trading 212 via the German market, instead of the NYSE. If you search 'GS2C' in the T212 search bar you will find GME under the DE and will be able to purchase shares. However, it is possible that T212 will catch on and limit people buying shares on this market as well. This takes me to the next solution.
2. Download a different broker app - FreeTrade allows one to make an account incredibly quickly and easily. You will need a pro account to make trades, which costs 9.99 a month, however you will make plenty more from trading GME stock. Furthermore, you will not be charged until February 3rd anyway so you can still opt out by that time.

Today I was trying to make new accounts in various apps and FreeTrade gave me the least hassle - I didn't have to go through leaps and bounds to make an account. I am in no way affiliated to FreeTrade it is just what I found best when trying to buy more GME stock today.

**So, why should you continue to buy and hold GME?**

Big hedge funds bet heaps of money that GME  would go bankrupt and have been put against a wall. If investors (and retail investors like us retards) hold, this forces the hedge funds to cover AKA buy back stock at whatever price is available AKA a short squeeze.

Time for some learning so take your rockets and listen the fuck up space-cadets: 

Now that I have your full attention - pretty much the butt pirates over at Melvin Capital **fucked up big time**. Melvin along with Citron Research (AKA Andrew ""Smoothbrain"" Left) and a few other companies shorted, expecting it to continue to lose ALL revenue. Now, the problem is, they overshorted GME by about \~140 fucking percent.

Essentially as long as investors can  HOLD  past the initial burst of buy-backs (which ***could*** be as soon as Friday with how many ITM options are sitting on Melvin's books). If you don't understand 'Days to Cover' I suggest doing some ACTUAL FUCKING RESEARCH but in short:

*""****Days to cover****, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.* ***Days to cover*** *is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question.""*

**Short Interest (Shares Short):** 61 - 71.2M

**Short Interest Ratio (Days To Cover):** 2.1 - 6.3

*^(\*there is some disparity here between data sources - approx. as of 28th Jan 2021)*

As long as everyone holds their GME stocks, this demand by Melvin and Citron will continue to drive up the price, and this can go on technically till GME hits X number because they can only close their positions once people start selling. Remove your fucking sell limits if you like money.

**No selling > no shorts closing > demand for the stock increases > price goes up even higher.** There is no ceiling to this, the power is in your hands to buy and hold.

The point here is, the covering will take **DAYS** to happen. DAYS. No space cadets left behind so get your fucking helmet ready for launch.

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

I think that WSB has - cleverly, cynically - milked GME for all (they think) it's worth, and are now tossing GME aside like a used condom. Which I think is fair (if a bit manipulative/cynical) to throw things aside once they've lost their usefulness to you. Humans do it all the time so I shouldn't be surprised.

Do you think it's a coincidence that DFV (GME's and WSB's biggest celebrity) posts his last update, and the mods decide to kill off GME, **on the same day**? I think not. When the goose (DFV) admits it will no longer lay golden eggs for you, you will feel free to kill it (ie the Megathread). They kept GME around because it kept DFV around. If the WSB mods told GME to fuck off to another sub back in January, DFV would probably have posted his YOLOs in the other sub. But nooo, they can't afford to lose their celebrity now, could they? You need to keep the horse! You only boil it down for glue *after* it has lost its usefulness, not before!

Like a clique of highschool mean girls, whilst the popular chick (DFV) was around, the WSB mods tolerated the chick's uglier sister (GME Apes) because they wanted the popular chick in their clique. Once the popular chick moves on (""final update""), they show their true claws and kick uglysis to the curb. Totally natural, happens in high schools all over the nation. So I'm not surprised it happened on WSB too (not that I'm calling the WSB mods highschool girls - that was purely an analogy, of course, of course, of course.)

We even have Daddy Elon on our side now, and if you autists have learned anything, its that you dont bet against Elon and walk away without consequences. I wont be surprised if a selloff happens soon, as shortsellers (for whatever reason) might still be trying to trigger a massive selloff. They know theyre knee-deep in shit swamp with no way out except to liquidate their positions and ironically buy GME shares themselves, which will drive price even further up. If we stay strong, GME can easily surpass 1000. Im betting we hit double at MINIMUM.

This is insane, but it is important to all newbies who want to make a quick buck to know why everyone is shouting ""HOLD"" and ""DIAMOND HANDS"" and ""DON'T SELL"" all the time.

The fact of the matter is this: When the short squeeze happens, the people who shorted the shares for GME will be FORCED TO BUY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE PRICE. Once this happens, demand will increase, triggering the next wave of shorters to cover their positions and buy at THE NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE.

                   

Now what I'm going to say next is possibly the most important part of this whole post: WE COLLECTIVELY CONTROL THE PRICES AT WHICH THE SHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARES. That's right, if 100% of people who owned shares in GME right now were to set their limit sells to $1000, then the shorts would be forced to buy at that price to cover their positions. This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

DON'T BE SCARED!! So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win. (If you want to of course this is not financial advice ;))

To the moon my dear retards!

As the weeks unfolded, I was happy. i was seeing my portfolio move thousands of dollars a day when GME was making a great run up. 

I was constantly on the sub reading about everyone else and their journey. I was up $25,000. Yeah, fucking $25,000. Now, for some of you, thats not a lot. But for a 20 year old working for $10 an hour thats a lot of fucking money. I had it all there, and didnt even think about selling... because it was gonna keep going up, right?

Now here i am, only up $1800, with my dick in my hand, waiting for another catalyst so we can hopefully squeeze again. What they did to all of us, ALL OF US, is nothing short of fucking robbery. All to protect dumb fucking billionaires that didnt know how manage risk. Fuck those hedge funds, fuck robinhood, fuck the SEC, fuck everyone that has been involved in this fucking fraudulent market. I hope we all get our tendies, because they did nothing short of opening up your wallet and taking out all your money. Actually even worse than that. 

good luck to all you apes. i hope we get some payback for these cocksuckers betting against us. also rip my $25,000.",-0.125529101,0.543915344

But none of it really ever sunk in until I found WSB and decided to pick the bug from my fellow apes head and take a bite. My first bite was to FOMO GME at $350. My portfolio crashed, like everyone else, and while I was 80% down, I didnt sell. I listened, I read, I learned. 

I found out about FUD. Wow. Like really, media is not on my side. They tried to say that you all were playing me and making me a bag holder. You said, , were coming back for you. For whatever reason, that comradely from strangers broke through the BS that was popping up on my news feed and made me dig deeper. 

I learned about the MACD, and about averaging down. I got my GME under $100 and then just buckled up and enjoyed life.

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that youll see today!!!

They  didnt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The  fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm  think the stock is being sold > price goes down > the found that  bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first  place > price drops even more > they keep doing that >  price drops lower every time > but as long as we hold they werent  able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long  as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you dont believe me, look  at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore  dont sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking  higher! Im talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to  the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per  share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND  )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND  )

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

  Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number  of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.   Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted  shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for  the company in question.  A high 'days to cover' ratio can often  signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

  imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days.  Same thing with covering short positions. How  long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their  short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the  average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called  ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes.

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that youll see today!!!

They  didnt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The  fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm  think the stock is being sold > price goes down > the found that  bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first  place > price drops even more > they keep doing that >  price drops lower every time > but as long as we hold they werent  able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long  as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you dont believe me, look  at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore  dont sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking  higher! Im talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to  the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per  share!!!

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND  )

Too  much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people  paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO  NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!)  so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

  Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number  of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.   Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted  shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for  the company in question.  A high 'days to cover' ratio can often  signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

  imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your  ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If  the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million  days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a  day, then it's 20 days.  Same thing with covering short positions. How  long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their  short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the  average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called  ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So  you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's  gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire  trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well,  we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering  their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are  bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying  for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot  of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get  shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now,  IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to  cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts  covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which  means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!  So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.

Disclaimer: I am that monkey. Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:

We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

1Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

2Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

3Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

4Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

5At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

6Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

7The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.

I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares. It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home. DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o)

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",0.01850515,0.479588532

Shorts recognize that we're almost all into our positions now. The outstanding float that isn't held by us is in their possession minus a few defectors on our side and 5-10% held by others. They are going to do EVERYTHING in their power to bring this down. ""Like what?"" you may ask...

1. Bot brigade negative sentiment on social media, reddit, etc. (this has yet to be common and could be more prevalent soon - though I have seen some new made accounts posting negative sentiment on GME)

2. Buying up the shares we don't have, driving up the price...
a) Hoping to create more liquidity for them by reducing our shares (more defectors as price goes up). 
b) So they can accumulate shares and manufacture large sell offs on volume to create what we saw earlier today

3. Persuade investors on reddit, social media, etc. that there are other better things to buy that will fuck shorts. Yes, there are plenty. But they want to spread us thin. BB, AMC, etc. are just the beginning. If we sell some of our shares to allocate to these and more that will be mentioned over the next couple weeks, we will lose. We will lose not only our strength in GME, but our strength in any focus of any short squeeze.

This is a war. We won the first battle and now they know we mean business. But we haven't won the war. They are going to pull shit that we won't see coming. We will be tested and this will not be easy. But we need to understand that if we persevere through this, we will not only come out rich for our early endeavors (because it's still early in this squeeze) but we will have power in bringing about actual change in the way large funds manipulate prices and how they manage risk.

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

Once upon a time, there was a man named Mr George Reedy.  He signed his paperwork : Mr G.Reedy.  He liked to buy and sell things that werent really his to sell. One day, he decided to focus on video games. 
  
He went to the video game store and saw that a brand new video game sold for $60. 
  
Well, this is too expensive!, he said to nobody in particular, for he was a lonely soul with no family or friends.  I simply refuse to pay this price, and besides, this game will be outdated soon, and nobody will care to play this game anymore.
  
So he contacted the makers of the game. He asked if he could borrow the game for a little while, with his utmost promise to sell it back at market value in a months time.
  
Mr G.Reedy thought he was oh so clever!!! He knew that games depreciate in value, and that in a months time, surely this $60 game would be worth half that, maybe even less!  He rubbed his hands in glee as the game makers let him borrow one hundred copies of this game.  
  
He bit his lip in excitement and trembled with joy as he held $6,000 worth of video games in his arms. He went up and down the street, and continued this same story.
  
Excuse me, good sir? Dont you want to buy this game? Its all the rage! He would ask person after person, and every so often someone would buy the game, and they would give him $60 for each copy.
  
After a few days of working with this, all the games were sold and he had a large stack of cash in his wallet totaling $6,000.  Now he just had to wait for the value of the game to go down in a month and he could go back to the game makers, and give them the expected street value, so maybe $3,000. Maybe!! If he got really lucky, the game was actually trash and hed only have to pay back $1000. Maybe less!!! If the game completely tanked, why, he might not have to pay anything back at all!!
  
Mr G.Reedy went to dinners, and threw a lavish party to buy new friends. He bought a car to impress potential lovers, but none of it worked as they all saw him for the slime he was.
  
And then the news came in.
  
People liked the game. Mr G.Reedy wasnt too worried though.  Games always depreciate. Every time. Whens the last time someone took a game in for a trade and got more than they paid? He laughed to himself as he sipped his champagne. It simply didnt happen.
  
And then the reviews came in.
  
People were talking about the game. It was the talk of the town. People were willing to hop onto EBay and and auction sites, and they were even paying $65 to $70 for this game. Mr G.Reedy still wasnt worried. It was just marketing hype, and he still had a good two weeks before the makers expected anything. He had time.
  
And then the media picked up on it.
  
The game was a once in a lifetime miracle the changed the rules of how games were made. The game maker had sold every copy they had, and people were clamoring for more. The price for a well worn copy of the game was now up over $100.  Now Mr G.Reedy was starting to get nervous.  His easy profit was slipping away.
  
He needed to make sure he had a couple copies in his hands for when the bank came calling. He took $3000 of his profits, and bought back 30 copies. At least he wouldnt owe the bank quite so much. He still had profit, and there was still time.
  
What he didnt count on, though, was that now that he had tucked away 30 copies for safe keeping, there was that much less on the market. Demand continued to grow, and the price shot up over $200 for each copy of this game that he had written off as a potential piece of trash.
  
Mr G.Reedy sat down and played a copy of the game. He shrugged his shoulders, and guessed there could be potential here, but it really wasnt worth all this noise that people were clamoring about.
  
And thats when he realized. Its not about the game. Its about what people will pay for it. These people paying $200 for a copy of the game were never going to play it. They just wanted to resell it for double, and here was poor Mr G. Reedy keeping an eye nervously on the door.
  
The limo pulled up. A large man with a suitcase in one hand, flanked by men with baseball bats walked up the pathway to his door.  The game makers had come, and they wanted their 100 games back, at market value which was now $20,000. 
  
Mr G.Reedy looked at his $3,000 in cash and 30 copies of the game and knew that he was well and truly in a lot of trouble.",-0.055411552999999995,0.38956004299999997

I won't answer any fucking questions from newbs.

1. Do you want to know why there seems to be a mass movement to push the narrative that the shorts have closed?

2. At 4PM today the NYSE reports the 1/15 short interest in stocks.

3. That report is going to show GME was shorted to fucking epically epic proportions.

4. The shorters telling the world they are out are still in.  They are trying to drive down the price before the report comes out.

5. Before I hear ""BBBBut that report is from 1/15, it's not current"" - It doesn't fucking matter.  Here's why- the report will show short interest from 1/15.  It's simple charting and math to see how much short interest was removed from 1/15 to today.  And what that math will show is that GME is still massively shorted at a level of 2x-4x the float.

(They attacked Robinhood, attacked wsb, attacked reddit. BUY THIS DIP)

So there has been a huge effort on the behalf of the shorts to mislead everyone. There idea is to misdirect. They said they got out of their short positions but the float is STILL 138.4% and the stock only got to 365 in AH where it's easy to manipulate price. For reference, AMC is 36.58%, Telsa is 8%.

GME is 138.4% they doubled down and are trying everyway to distract you to other stocks. My guess would be they are the ones pumping up AMC because they know most Robinhood users can do anything unless they sell their GME positions. They NEED your shares to get out of this jam. If you sell, you give them the ammo to do it. People are asking is the squeeze over? The squeeze didn't even start yet by the look of it.

They want you to run over to some other short positions. They figure if all of us take profits today they will accumulate enough shares to tank it and shake out the weak paper hands giving them more ammo.

If you hold and don't touch your commons. You will be part of the largest squeeze and transfer of wealth in history. The fed caused this by this extra liquidity which allowed greed to run rampant. This isn't our fault they double down and never took profits. The greed that was allowed on their behalf was insane here. 138.4% short. This is life changing money for many of us. Myself included. I could pay off debt, student loans, have money for my kids college.

Diamond hands. Buy every dip.

They are trying to distract you with AMC, BB, BBBY. Telling you the squeeze is over when they actually doubled down. They think we are idiots, let's show them how smart it is to double down against people with very little to lose in comparison to them. Don't worry, they will just get a government bail out and do it again. This is our time people.

Got on late January on the initial run up.  I would say am a millennial.  I was just after the tards and before the apes.  I showed up right when things were already getting a bit tarded.  Bought in, sold, bought back in.  I didn't fully understand the premise back then.   

I had 100 shares of BB which doubled, well my overall gains which were short term, around the same time GME was going crazy.  I ended up selling some of  my GMe for more BB.  Then shortly after saw I was $1600 in the red on BB.  That one was being pumped on WSB as well as AMC and NOK.  I got fooled once there.   Even bought and sold AMC.

Eventually I learned there is only 1 play and that is the one we are all here for.  For several reasons beyond the poetry and simulation game mindfuckl of it all.  GME is the way.  This is the way

The share expansion is a moot point in 2021, unless Adam was fibbing and I don't think he really wants to reverse course after making such a strong case in his recent interview.

I would expect if he makes any comment on this is, it's going to be along the lines of, its clear Shareholders don't want the expansion at this time. I promised them I wouldn't use any of such shares in Calendar year 2021 anyway. We don't ""Need"" to use any currently or in the forseeable 2021 future.  We can always revisit this when conditions, needs and objectives of the company have changed. It isn't needed currently.

Just my thoughts.  Not financial or any other sort of advice.

EDIT:  The Board has reserved the right to reintroduce the proposed share expansion at any time in the future.  (I would have done the same thing, honestly)  I think this is a good thing and removes the possibility of creation of a divide between Shareholders of AMC and AMC's leadership.  Sometimes share dilution is necessary but Adam already firmly indicated that it isn't needed now or going forward in 2021.  So why push the issue, imo.  He and the Board appear to be yielding to Shareholders stance on this.  Also a smart move.

Thank you for the post to remind/inform folks about what happened and what was going on at the time. Just some additions from my perspective:

I was new to stocks around September last year and I was frequenting WSB. I remember that there were rumors that GameStop was trying to transition to e-commerce and that the stock was possibly undervalued. Also some random dude decided to yolo his money on that transition (DFV). Also, some dude from Chewy bought in and became a major holder of GME (RC). Honestly, at that time, I thought it was all fucking crazy. I naively thought that GameStop was failing. Of course GME started gaining steam end of last year before spiking in January. I actually bought an option 11/19/21 $25 call in December. At the time, I thought it was a bet on maybe GME making a turnaround after 2021 Q2 earnings. I still have that call 

Also as we all probably know, WSB is all about options with the gain and loss porns being popular. I do distinctly remember that the play for GME was actually not call options, but buying shares because when the squeeze was in possible, no one knows when it will occur. 

Finally, when the January squeeze happened, I remember that people were looking for other squeeze possibilities. As I remember people saw a bunch of stocks that were shorted. Then I think people FOMOd on GME by investing in BB, AMC, and NOK. Although I think there was some DD about BB turning it around based on a partnership with AMZN. 

Anyway, Im just agreeing that GME was the original play based on the e-commerce turnaround which became a short squeeze play and that AMC, as I remember it, was always a secondary play of a possible short squeeze after the GME squeeze in January.",0.004454545,0.542515152
31896,5/14/2021,17:28,5/14/2021 17:28,gy3ii2c,1621027704,"GME is the play.

I also don't believe in AMC as a play *but* I think that it's possible that AMC apes, through pure stubborn apeheadedness, have kinda made it a play. Hedge funds put forward AMC as a play in WSB as an initial distraction, then so many people started diamond handing it that they're now stuck in shorts there, too.

Obviously, with a larger float and lower SI% AMC their squeeze will be smaller but the initial buy in is also lower, I honestly hope it squeezes first so the AMC apes can jump over here with some of their tendies.

AMC used the Jan run to get themselves out of debt and raise money, the company is pretty strong, once people start going out again they will be a solid company again, but they have no transformation plan, they're just gonna keep being a movie theater(maybe with in movie food but that's not innovation, that's following your competition).",0.16054421800000002,0.47619047600000003

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that youll see today!!!

They didnt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold > price goes down > the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place > price drops even more > they keep doing that > price drops lower every time > but as long as we hold they werent able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you dont believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore dont sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! Im talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND  )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND  )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

	Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. 	Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. 	A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

	imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. 	Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 3 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Tues or Wed next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 120% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

                                                                    

And of course, this isnt financial advice. Im literally retarded.

Why would people want to go to the movies you ask? (Movie theaters have always done well during recessions if you are concerned about the future, AMC  should be valued around 30$ or more due to inflation; yet the stock is only about 1/3 of that at the moment). 

I bought some AMC at 18; if I can buy in and hold at 18 then you can buy in when its low and watch the gains come in and flow like water! (Thank me later). 

We are going to take AMC, GME, BB, and NOK to the moon! Dont panic, never sell low! I know youve heard this a million times.. HOLD!!

(Buy low, sell high) ... well we arent selling though just yet, we are holding tell these hedge funds fold and we get the funds we DESERVE. Law suites and congress hearings are INCoMinG.

Well, millions of people have been waiting for some the movies that are coming out this year for DECADE(s), 
-Top Gun 
-Avatar 2 (made billions and set records)
-Dune Reboot 
- Matrix 4 
- Cinderella 
- 101 Dalmatians 
- Spawn Reboot 
- Venom 2 
(This is just a few of them) (100s of millions have gone into these movies and guess what they make money, ALOT of it) .. especially the opening week/month in theaters!

Today we have gotten so much publicity (the publicity we got today showed us the hedge fund managers put all their cards on the table, risking jail time for blatant stock manipulation). These hedge fund companies got swallowed alive on Twitter today). They even lost more money on GME despite all of their efforts to destroy it today! 

If ANYONE knows the power of social media its Reddit. WSB has gone up millions of new users;  many new retail investors are coming in to join the war and get on the  to the  !! 

GME, AMC, BB, NOK  (the war just started) and this is far from over; so, tonight is the night where we get ready for the battle tomorrow for our precious Diamonds! Get a little rest and eat some food if you can!! Be mentally vigilant tomorrow! dont get paper hands if you see some high dips; this is the time to buy more and fuck the hedge funds; their strategies as you already know are FUCKED (they have some secret tricks up their sleeves, but so do we)... buy those dips and fuck them where it hurts! 

In all sales jobs we would have a rally with the team before the day to get everyone hyped up! Lets get hyped up this morning guys! Together! Everyone do your part on social media and the comments, if millions of us do we we are just giving ourselves more publicity! We *HOLD* and buy on the dips! 

It was so nice seeing Congress, Celebs and lots of other high profile people being on the retail investors side! 

PS - Psych 101 - you never tell someone they cant do something ie. You cant buy but you can sell (reverse psychology is real) however, this was the only hand the hedge funds could play to keep from loosing everything today.. telling people not to buy is just going to make them want to buy more, and more. DONT BE AFRAID, we are in this war together. We may not win every battle, but we WILL win the war ! Too much publicity not to at this point. See you guys on the moon.

Melvin Capital doesnt have shares to gobble up (their private and dont have shares; they have LPs), and Melvin was not short GME in any size. They had a tiny put on GME, which expired last week and no more. Melvin didnt get margin called either; they were facing redemptions and got whacked on their long portfolio which was in a bunch of illiquids. Pt72 and Citadel entered into a revenue sharing agreement, which you NEVER do in a teetering fund. You do that when you expect the fund to outperform.

Source: work at hedge fund and know all of these people. Every hedge fund of size runs a counterparty desk and their sole job is to know exactly whats going on at other banks/hedge funds (your counterparties) - Pt72 and Melvin are telling all desks they are/were fine and this whole thing is kinda funny and weird. Melvin is down for the year, but nowhere near 30% on a gross AUM basis.

And if you really want to argue, go find the source of the rumor that Melvin is short GME. Theres a single 13F from Nov 2020 that shows a $50M GME put....and nothing more. Short positions dont show up on filings, and nobody would know unless Melvin published their short, but that hasnt happened. So where is the source of this rumor? Find it - I dare you. I know news sites are reporting it as fact, but I literally had a reporter from a major financial news outlet asking me if I knew where it came from. I told the reporter, you know were all laughing about this....

Theres no short squeeze - this is a pure-play mania and it will end just like past stock manias....badly.

Lastly, if you dont know how 1) a stock can have 110% short interest and still have a net long exposure, 2) how an individual fund can be short a stock and simultaneously net long, youre gonna get fucked when this corrects.

-

Look at melvins Nov 13F filing. They absolutely had a $50M put, which is a flavor of a short position. That put expired worthless on 1/22. So they told the truth. But my point is that $50M in a $20 billion portfolio is nothingness and definitely wont squeeze shit. GME is trading like $20B to $30B per hour.

This is part of the reason that wall st is laughing: to trigger a squeeze, you need a huge short position relative to the daily volume traded. So if a stock has $10B of shares shorted and trades like $1B per day, thats a great set up for a squeeze. Why? Bc there are not enough shares being traded for a fund to cover their position, so they have to bid up the market to induce more selling supply. Stock price goes up more, and thats a squeeze.

On the other hand, GME is trading the entire short float multiple times per day. Theres simply no way for a squeeze to happen mechanically - there are waaaaaaaay too many shares openly being traded to make it difficult for a fund to cover their shorts. GME is one of the most liquid stocks on the market today. Theres no there there.

NO HEDGE FUND HAS TO BUY IN THEIR SHORTS EVER. WSB has no fucking clue whats going on in reality.

The short interest right now is either 1) options dealers hedging the insane number of puts outstanding (and/or any synthetic positions out), and 2) it is trivial for a sophisticated hedge fund to have a short position in a stock and be net long (profiting when it goes up). In fact, the few funds playing this right now are doing precisely that. Point is, THERE IS NO GUARANTEED SHORT SQUEEZE and no fund is on the clock - hedge funds can work their balance sheets until WSB is a smoldering hole of tendies turned to ashes.

And as for this AMC thing, this is literally hedge funds taking money from WSB - they flipped the converts, and guess who bought it....WSB. Im sure they send their thanks while they are in private planes down to Barbuda.

There can never be a situation where the stock is in a bubble and everyone wins. Everyone DOES win when the stock is fairly valued and shareholders value grows as the companys does. But when the stock is in a market bubble with nothing pushing up the value but more people buying in, then its bound to sell off at some point. People who bought in are bound to lose. Even without the brokers restricting trades, this sell off was bound to happen. This is basic finance 101. Most of you who bought in were bound to lose your money anyways, just like people who bought the dot com bubble at the top, just like people who bought the VW short squeeze, D***c***, etc. The brokers didnt want to restrict trades on these stocks - they were made to by their clearing houses because the clearing houses didnt want to be on the hook for when most of you tards became insolvent.

The  Subreddit was founded a while  ago, very near the birth of reddit and  existed mainly as a place for  traders to meme about their investments,  promote risky gambles (hence  the name), post gain porn (stonk going  up), and loss porn (stonk going  down). It was just a chill place for  experienced investors (and  compulsive gamblers lmao) to joke about the  OTM calls they were going  all in on. The subreddits founder, and head  mod for the longest time, the creator  saw dollar signs in his eyes when  the sub started picking up speed a  little under a year ago. He  basically attempted to monetize the sub, and  started demodding/banning  anyone (including lower mods) that stood up  to him. With the help of  the admins, the good mods managed to get him  removed, and lead the  sub back on track zjz , the one in the post above, being their leader  and the highest active mod.

Now  that wsb has exploded into the mainstream, other mods who were not the  founder, but had been given modship before zjz  , have returned. They  have been inactive for years and done sweet fuck  all to help the sub  grow. They are exercising their power as higher  mods to try and take  credit and monetize wsb, now that it is  mainstream. zjz was unmodded  and banned for exposing this and they are frantically  deleting comments  trying to bring this fact to light. These people are  money grabbing  assholes trying to reap the benefits of something that  has been  carefully built by a team of genuine people, spread the word,  dont let  them. If you have any spare coins or free awards please give  them to  this post (not my comment, the post itself) to signal boost  this.

UPDATE: [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/)   is shedding mods left and right. They seem to be removing everyone   critical of their scummy decisions. Theyre relying on suppressing this   info long enough to make a profit without the millions of newbs or the   media noticing a change in mods. HELP GET THIS TO THE ADMINS ATTENTION.   They have stepped in before when someone tried to monetize this   subreddit, and the head mod doing it now is a close personal friend   (unconfirmed, just info Ive seen) of the original founder who was   removed. There is reason to believe they will step in again.

UPDATE   2: They appear to be adding new mod accounts. No idea if those are   their alts or their friends or just fillers to keep the number of mods   the same. The more shady shit I see the more hopeful I get that daddy [u/spez](https://www.reddit.com/u/spez/) will see this situation and do the right thing here

Look at the Open Interest (OI) column, this indicates the total number of option contracts that are held by investors in active positions. The Volume represents the number of options contracts being exchanged between buyers and sellers.

There is a huge drop off in options contracts below $15. If BB closes tomorrow below $15, then all these contracts will expire worthless. If BB closes above $30 tomorrow, then all these contracts will be ITM and Wallstreet will have to fork over a pretty penny to pay these out. They are manipulating the stock for their benefit.

Edit: Getting a lot of private messages about this, If you have to ask which option you should buy tomorrow, just buy shares. This is just my person opinion and not professional investment advice.

Edit 2: For those asking if we don't hit $30/$20/$15 today, still hold your positions. Wall Street is trying to scare us into selling. The higher the price today, the maximum the pain to their wallets, but this stock trends with GME/AMC. Once they go up we go up. The squeeze is not over!

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.
2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.
3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.
4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.
5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.
6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.
7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that [/u/draemon\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/draemon_/) provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. (THANKS for this info,** [/u/blancochocolate](https://www.reddit.com/u/blancochocolate/)**)**

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.\*

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU,** [/u/catolicquotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/catolicquotes/)

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are forced sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or prop desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing volatility**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated dumps of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

I understand not allowing buys on margin accounts, but they didnt allow buying of shares in cash accounts. They posted an announcement saying no options trading on a few different companies. You need 100% margin if you want to buy shares in those companies. And 300% margin to short them. 

Then they still didnt allow buying of GME shares in cash accounts. Later that day they didnt allow BB purchases either.

I learned about the big short mortgage bubble while working for a very huge cc company via a memo I wasnt supposed to see on my bosses desk. They pulled a couple billion from reserves to cover the upcoming losses and our jobs were going to be offered up to ease the pain.
Management had been shuffling at the time and that clarified everything.  

After that point I swore Id never work for another corporation again.  I did of course shortly after but couldnt handle the politics of starting again at a lower tiered company so I sold out and moved far North away from the big metro city in 2010 to raise my son and rebuild something for my little family.

This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound.

Before GME became the meme stock that everyone knew about, it was a frequent topic of discussion on WSB. But, these discussions were almost always two sided: one side sure that GME would go to the moon and the other side sure that it would crater. Furthermore, it wasnt the only stock that was talked about. 

Then the end of January happened and the stock became I became international news. Within a week WSB went from being a sub of <2,000,000 members to having 9,000,000 subbed. 

And the new GME people were **active**. All other discussions were getting drowned out. The original members were getting upset that it was GME all the time. After several days, I think the mods finally started to clamp down on low value posts (posts where basically the entire message contained no information besides HODL). Lots of posts were from people who had no idea what they were talking about. And anyone offering a view that wasnt considered pro-GME would get massively downvoted. Basically a cult was developing to the point where WSB was just GME. 

Also, as another poster mentioned, there was a mod turnover (some mods were in talks with folks to do a movie deal in secret until another one of the mods blew the whistle  Reddit eventually had to get involved). 

Im not sure when r/GME became a thing, but I want to say that it was early February. The WSB mods from February to March have done an amazing job of clamping down on posts and its moving to something closer to what it used to be. 

For what its worth, we still talk about GME on r/WallStreetBets . Its just that the hurdle to get a post to go anywhere is much higher (which IMO is a good thing). 

I havent been on GME much, but what little Ive seen is that it is very much in the vein of r/conspiracy. Lots of speculation, lots of BS, and no real voice of reason. In other words, a giant echo chamber.",0.09484497800000001,0.531885522

All this insider trading, blatantly illegal shit ruining people's lives, blowing up worthless companies or shorting perfectly good companies into the ground was making me sick. I left and never looked back. 

I joined WSB for the memes but then found out you can easily sift through the wheat from the chaff. GME caught my eye and I went in for the money. I never expected this to happen. At this point it's no longer about the money for me, but sending a message. 

A family friend is a finance professor and he once said to me, ""hey you know what I like to watch? National Geographic. You wanna know why? To remind me what we are. We are all animals, the strong eat the weak, tearing the faces off those that cannot fight back. Don't ever forget that it's a cold hard world out there."" 

When 2008 happened who got arrested? Nobody. They kept repeating no institution is too big to avoid investigation but they did absolute fuck all. Top execs still got away with enough money to buy private jets. Money that was people's entire life savings. People that needed that money to survive, for medicine, for their children's education, for getting out of crushing poverty, to get out of the endless cycle of debt and compound interest. 

Now they have the audacity to call us criminals? What fucking hypocrisy. 

Stand with me now brothers. Stand with me and hold until they bleed out of every orifice. Send them a message that we will take this no longer. Either we fold and go back to the rich endlessly robbing the poor, or we stand our ground and say no, no more. 

WE HOLD FOREVER.

Demoralization - this is a process which can take about 1-2 days and one subreddit ban to perform (A complete fuckery). During this stage, the moral fibre and integrity of the retail investors is attempted to be put into question, thereby creating doubt in the minds of the people who saw a yahoo article about it, bought in, and paper handed when it moved 2 cents. To do so, manipulation of the media and markets is required to influence actual autists. As the bots, hedge funds and literal autists attempt to generate massive price drops, such as after market price dumps, the the tendie town retards and autists would slowly loses control simply through attrition. Again, true facts no longer matter during this stage, but rather creating perceptions of actual bandwagoning autists are of paramount importance.

Destabilization - the purpose of this step is to retain the status quo, particularly the retail investors economy, and defense systems ()The intent is to create a massive government permeating society and becoming intrusive in the lives of the tendie making autists . This can take from one AH period to perform, again with the active support of bots and boomer media pushing the actual autists in this direction. Here, risks and warnings are whined about to the average joe autists to encourage their support for keeping us from tendie town . Basically, they are bribing the real autists to accept their programs.

Crisis - this is a major step and involves a revolutionary change of share price. This is where a cataclysmic event upsets and divides the retail investors thereby attempting to create panic among the autists. To retail investor retards and autists, symptoms would include circumventing the Constitution and the first amendment right to free speech, and altering the checks and balances of government, and possibly whining to the SEC

Normalization - the final stage is where the autists finally acquiesces and begins to assimilate Goliath fucking Davids wife. This is what we have to avoid.

This is the strategy we have to recognise and avoid. They are doing this intentionally to divide and crush our efforts at fighting back at those who have fucked us over for years. Those who brought our parents to tears and put our livelihoods on the line by gambling our entire futures back in 2008 while you were in a COD 4 lobby crying because a 35 year old Coomer called you a squeaker and said you were shit at the game.

Weve done something no one has ever made them do before and thats bleed. Bleed money. Were beating them at their own game. For the first time we have power to fuck over these TITANS OF INDUSTRY. Now Im not gonna say I have a ton of stock in NOK, BB, AMC, or even GME, I actually have very little in all 4, but I can say thank you. Thank you for showing me that there is still hope for the human race and that together we can over come the corruption that is prevalent is every facet of our so it. Either way that I come out of this I will praise wallstreetbets for what theyve done for us. The average people. And thats give us a platform to speak to each other and connect to each other in an unprecedented way. From the bottom of my heart thank you.   together!",0.052678570999999993,0.525689223

Feel free to use my complaint summary if you agree:

Robinhood has gone against the fiduciary duty of its market client base, along with his companys motto of democratizing finance for all by participating in market manipulation. Robinhood has banned the purchase of several NYSE listed equities securities including GME, AMC, BB, and NOK. This is a mockery of the United States foundational characteristic of free markets. Clearly, Robinhood, along with other similar broker dealers, have no interest in the free market or for individual investors. Rather, they serve the interests of hedge fund corporations who have most likely persuaded these firms to engage in market manipulation in order to mitigate losses enacted by short selling. An investigation into Robinhood and similar broker/dealers, along with the hedge funds who have recently lost profits due to their negligent short positions in the stocks mentioned above should take place in order to preserve whats left of the American democracy.",0.012878788,0.429545455

""Dear Robinhood,

You claim your platform's name is Robinhood. But you're actually just Robbinhood. I can't even begin to discuss how disgusting this is. I understand you want to IPO and suck up to these hedge funds but you are obviously blatantly manipulating the market. I can't even begin to express how ridiculous this is, manipulating FREE trade. This brokerage was a joke to begin with but we used you because it was easy and had a cult following. I just want to say, here is a big fuck you for making me lose all of my money. We will ALL collectively file a class action suit. We will ALL leave to other platforms. We will ALL short the shit out of your stock when you IPO. We will NOT stop. We will keep fucking buying GameStop as we please.
